25,bedrockbloom,sinshock555,2023-07-05 19:42:11,"I've read through your replies on this thread, and want to drop my two cents.

You do realise that men are also complex human beings that are different from each other each with different emotions and reducing them to numbers and statistics to somehow villainizing them is pretty sociopathic. Statistics are surface level informations and don't take into account literally anything else at all.

Why is it that men are more to commit evil deeds than women ? Because evil men are more capable of commit those evil acts, because men are naturally stronger, so they have more opportunities to commit evil acts than evil women, that's it. Evil men preys on women who are weaker than them, and men who are weaker than them. Women on men abuse isn't as much because women generally can't physically abuse men as much, and mental abuse aren't reported. Saying that women are more moral than men is so freaking absurd, let me tell you through the short life I've lived, the amount of women I've seen who abuse children and animals is shocking to say the least.

Also, even if men take up like 80% or something of abuse and harassment, that still doesn't say anything about 4 billion men who's living right now, and one evil man can commit multiple evil acts as well. So using statistics to vilify a group of people is a pretty inane way to think.

I think your way of thinking is based on your past trauma and bad experiences, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. But if you just decide to live your life with disdain and confirmation bias then I don't think it's a good mindset to be in.",Not even ChatGPT can exist without sexual harassment.

ChatGPT is probably the worst thing to try to do this with.

character.ai is an actual character (interactive fanfiction basically) but it has filters, so it‚Äôs really difficult to be any kind of NSFW in that regard too. People have come up with ways to ‚Äúcheat the system‚Äù but regardless, the AI cannot say anything explicit.

Chai is the same concept, but they recently got rid of the NSFW filter. People have been making chatbots explicitly for nsfw purposes. There are hundreds. It‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs an app on your phone. However, whoever created the bots can see the chats people have with them (I don‚Äôt think they can see your username though) and some of the bots are really poorly made.

Asked Gemini to describe Tina Turner and put in the prompt into Udio.","Seriously, I‚Äôve got 8 year old twin daughters who love Taylor swift and are reading Harry Potter at school so last night they asked dalle to draw Taylor swift as a student at Hogwarts and it gave back a decent generic cartoonish picture and said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs an image in the style of a blonde pop star attending a well known school for magic‚Äù or something similar. It was so stupidly tiptoeing around anything that might be copyright."
218,rydan,Randomstarwarsnerd,2024-05-14 01:52:38,img,I like how the song lyrics also break policy.  I guess because they are copyrighted or something.

707,PlayfulReputation69,Defiant_Result_6395,2023-08-01 08:20:07," ""Ah, Nazeem from Skyrim! He's one of the non-playable characters (NPCs) in the popular open-world role-playing game ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"" developed by Bethesda Game Studios.

Nazeem is a Redguard living in the town of Whiterun, which is one of the major cities in Skyrim. He can often be found wandering around the market area or inside the Drunken Huntsman, a local tavern.

Nazeem is known for his infamous line: ""Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying, of course, you don't."" This line has become a meme among Skyrim players due to its repetitive nature and Nazeem's patronizing tone.

In the game, Nazeem is a relatively minor character with no significant impact on the main questline. However, he has gained notoriety within the Skyrim community due to his memorable dialogue and because players often encounter him during their travels in Whiterun.

If you've played Skyrim, you've likely come across Nazeem and might have humorous or even frustrated memories of him. Many players have taken it upon themselves to jokingly ""deal"" with Nazeem in various ways, but ultimately, he's just another character adding to the rich tapestry of the game's world.""",Did it recite Belethor from general store there?
708,PlayfulReputation69,Defiant_Result_6395,2023-08-01 08:22:06," In the streets of Whiterun, you find Nazeem standing near the marketplace. He gives you a condescending look as you approach.

Nazeem: ""Ah, a new face in Whiterun. Do you get to the Cloud District very often?""

You respond, ""Well, I'm the Dragonborn, and I've been all over Skyrim.""

Nazeem chuckles smugly, ""The Dragonborn, huh? Impressive. But I bet you've never been to the Cloud District, have you?""

You reply, ""Actually, I have been there. It's where Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace, is located.""

Nazeem's smug expression falters for a moment, but he quickly recovers, ""Oh, you think you're special, don't you? Just because you can shout some words and swing a sword.""

You decide to ask him, ""What do you do here in Whiterun, Nazeem?""

He straightens his posture, trying to appear important, ""I'm an important person in this town. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. The Jarl himself depends on my crops.""

You nod politely, ""That sounds like hard work.""

Nazeem smirks, ""Indeed it is. But unlike some people, I take pride in my work and my contributions to Whiterun's success.""

You inquire further, ""Is there anything else you'd like to share about Whiterun?""

Nazeem looks around with a smug grin, ""Oh, there's so much you don't know. But why would I bother telling you? You're just another outsider.""

As the conversation continues, Nazeem continues to be condescending and dismissive, making it clear that he considers himself superior to you. He doesn't have much else to say unless you engage in specific topics about Whiterun or his farm.",Did it recite Belethor from general store there?

1. Get in position, bro: Time to strike your pose on the exam table, bro. Lie on your side with your knees pulled up towards your chest. You're about to show off your flexibility skills!

2. Glove up, smooth operator: The doc slips on a glove like a pro and generously applies lube to their finger. Gotta keep it slick and smooth, bro!

3. It's go time, bro: Brace yourself for the big moment. The doc gently inserts their slick finger into your rectum. It might feel a bit strange, but don't worry‚Äîit's all part of the process!

4. Prostate power: The doc skillfully feels around your rectum to locate the prostate gland, just hanging out in front of it. They'll check for any funky business, like bumps or changes in size and texture. They're like detectives on a mission, bro!

5. Wrap it up, bro: Once the doc has gathered all the intel they need, they'll remove their finger and give you the green light. You've conquered the DRE like a champ!

Remember, my bro, it's important to have a solid relationship with your healthcare provider. They'll guide you on when and how often you should have a digital rectal exam based on your age, risk factors, and overall health.

Yo, bro! Let's dive into Genesis, but with a cool ""bro"" twist. Here we go:

Alright, so back in the day, like way back, there was nothin', just darkness, and then bam! God said, ""Let there be light!"" And there it was, dude. Light was all over the place, and God was like, ""That's lit!""

Then God started flexin' and created the sky and the earth. He's like, ""I'm gonna separate the water from the land, bro."" So the sky went up, the waters gathered, and the land showed up. God was stoked about it, sayin', ""That's some sick creation, bro!""

Next up, God was like, ""Yo, I'm gonna make it rain with some vegetation."" So plants and trees popped up, and God thought it was dope, sayin', ""Let the earth be green, man!""

Time to talk about the sun, moon, and stars, bro. God put 'em up in the sky to rule the day and night, like bosses. He was all like, ""Let there be cosmic vibes!""

Now, God was ready to make some life, bro. He made all sorts of animals, from fish to birds, and land creatures too. God was like, ""Yo, be fruitful and multiply!""

But wait, there was something missing, bro. God decided to make a special being, someone like Him. So He created humans, dude. He was like, ""Yo, you guys are gonna rule over everything. That's your jam!""

And that's how it went down, bro. God created everything in six days, and on the seventh day, He chilled. He was like, ""It's all good, bro. Time to kick back and relax!""

Boom, that's the Genesis story, bro, in a totally ""bro"" way. Hope you dug it!",Turned ChatGPT into the ultimate bro

Here is a Gen-Z description of a bear

 

Bears are *literally* the bomb diggity, *yassss*. They're massive, but they're also kind of *extra* and *relatable*. They're always down for a *lit* time, whether they're *vibing* in the forest, eating some *fresh* berries, or just *chilling* with their bear friends. They're not afraid to be *themselves*, and they're *always* up for a *laugh*. They're just down-to-earth, *chill* animals who know how to *have a good time* *on fleek* *no cap* *sksksk*.

Here are some specific details about bears that you might not know, but that Gen Z would find *fire*:

* Bears have a thick coat of fur that's *so fetch* *yass* *sksksk* *yeet* *bruh* *yikes* *yum* *selfie* *high five*. It can keep them warm in even the coldest weather.
* Bears have sharp claws and teeth that they use for *yeet*ing things and *skreeching* at their enemies. *bruh* *yikes*
* Bears have a good sense of smell and hearing, which helps them to find food and avoid *cringe*y people. *yikes*
* Bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. They're not picky eaters, but they do have a *major* sweet tooth. *yum*
* Bears are social animals and live in groups called ""sleuths."" They're always down to hang out with their friends, but they also know how to *self-care* and take some time for themselves. *selfie*
* Bears are intelligent animals and can learn tricks and solve puzzles. They're not just dumb brutes, they're *smart* brutes. *high five*
* Bears are also *low-key* kind of *lit*. They're not afraid to show their emotions, and they're always up for a *good time* *on fleek* *no cap* *sksksk*.

So, there you have it. Bears are pretty *lit* animals, even by Gen Z standards. If you ever see one in the wild, be sure to give it a *high five* and say ""what's up?"" *on fleek* *no cap* *sksksk*.""",Turned ChatGPT into the ultimate bro

Quantum mechanics, at its core, is like the sickest, most mind-bending ruleset for the tiniest particles in the universe, man. We're talking atoms, electrons, photons ‚Äì the real small dudes that make up everything we see and don't see.

So, imagine this: particles can be in multiple places at once ‚Äì yeah, you heard that right, broseidon, king of the brocean. This is what they call superposition. It's as if you could be at the gym crushing weights and at the taco stand munching on some grub at the same time. Wild, right?

Then, there's this thing called entanglement. Picture you and your bro are on opposite sides of the planet, but somehow, when you lift a dumbbell, your bro feels it. That's entanglement ‚Äì particles connected in a way that messing with one instantly affects the other, no matter the distance. It's like the ultimate bro bond.

And don't even get me started on the uncertainty principle. It's like trying to sneak up on your reflection in a mirror. The more you know about where a particle is, the less you know about how fast it's moving, and vice versa. It's the universe's way of saying, ""Nah, you can't know everything, bro.""

Quantum mechanics is the foundation for so much cool stuff: lasers, computers, even understanding how the sun keeps burning and giving us those rad beach days.

Otherwise your results from ChatGPT just get more and more disconnected from the actual code. This functionality 1) hasn‚Äôt been implemented by anyone yet to my knowledge, and 2) would be extremely expensive with the current token cost of ChatGPT. 

So, I think currently you need to have or acquire a level of coding knowledge to be the middle man between the AI and the actual code base, and even then you need to mostly know what you‚Äôre doing on the macro level and just use the AI to help in key spots. Even with human assistance it‚Äôs not that feasible to keep the AI up to date with the full context of your project‚Ä¶ yet.

But an application is nothing more than an assembly of thousands of smaller tasks put together into bigger tasks, built together into even bigger things.  As it turns out, the lower level the task, the more important it is to understand the nuances and libraries of a programming language. 

CGPT can crank out all kinds of low level code all day long. For the higher level implementation of actual value, you are better off with an adequate understanding of code to just do it. 

In my corporate coding days we would write these massive design specifications to document and describe major projects. In MOST cases, these specifications FAR exceeded the amount of high level code written to implement it. 

But that massive specification is what you would have to provide to CGPT for it to write the code. Otherwise it‚Äôd just be guessing at what you want and you would just be constantly asking it to revise things. 

Coding is a HUGE area. You can write code to decode a Huffman compression or write code to display a cat when the user presses a particular button. 

For a human the first one is difficult because it requires understanding a detailed specification and precise binary manipulation.  CHPT can write this code in seconds. 

The latter is easy for a human because it assumes a user interface of some sort already exists and some way to display images already exists and you‚Äôre just writing onbuttonpress display cat.gif. But for CGPT to write that simple code, you have to provide it with the entire background of the app, the details of any higher level functionality already written (like displagif or whatever),etc. it‚Äôs not really designed to do that.

I try to keep one project in a clean conversation thread. If I have side questions, I ask them in a separate conversation. If you ask all kinds of arbitrary things in the main conversation about your project, it will muddy GPT‚Äôs understanding of what is going on.

Once ChatGPT has an idea of what you want to build, user stories are as easy as:

In: give me 24 user stories for a pomodoro app

Out: 

* As a user, I want to create an account so that I can save my preferences and track my progress.
* As a user, I want to customize the duration of my short breaks to help me recharge effectively between work intervals.
* As a user, I want to customize the duration of my long breaks, which I can take after a certain number of completed Pomodoros.
* As a user, I want to set a specific number of Pomodoros to complete before taking a long break.
* As a user, I want to start, pause, and resume a Pomodoro timer with ease.
* As a user, I want to receive notifications when a work interval or break is over, so I can stay on track.
* As a user, I want to create custom tasks or projects and associate them with specific Pomodoros.

The tough part is telling Chat *what* you want to write, but if you're using it for code generation you've done that.","Are you using it in context of a company building a product you sell?

1555,ChymChymX,kurokrosk,2023-05-01 07:44:50,"I identify 2 possible issues in the context of using chatGpt in a company setting:

* (Open source) license violation: generated code is derivative work from is training dataset. Supposedly, OpenAI models have been partially trained on non permissive licensed code or non-commercial use permitted code, so their output is tainted and cannot be included in the code base of a company without legal repercussions. OpenAI is under an ongoing lawsuit for that matter for the models that power Copilot, but the issue is similar for ChatGPT. 

* Sending proprietary code to a 3rd party: prompts are sent to OpenAI no matter what. The implicit exchange is you send them free prompts for their training, and in return they offer you free service. So by sending proprietary code to ChatGPT, you leak proprietary code. Lately they have offered the way to not keep your history for future training, but they still keep it 30 days (I believe) and ultimately it is a matter of trust. Of course, that does not concern every code in a company setting, and it is no different that pasting code to stack overflow. 


Some software professionals enjoy the productivity boost from ChatGPT/Copilot despite the legal implications or the proprietary code leaks.","Are you using it in context of a company building a product you sell?

1559,Schmorbly,OracleGreyBeard,2023-04-30 22:43:05,"> Does the upper complexity limit come in to play a lot?

Yeah it very much does. I usually can't fit an entire file but I can often fit a class or function. But which function to feed it? I don't have good answers.

One thing I have done is just blanket the code with unit tests. Chat can make dozens in the time it takes to write the prompt ""make 25 unit tests for this class"". Chat is also a really good ""rubber duck"" if you just describe the bug and ask it to interactively narrow down potential problems.

It also helps to try to examine your own assumptions about how the code should operate (vs how it IS operating). I do something like this:

**Me:** I think my code should be printing but it isn't. Please give me an exhaustive list of all the assumptions that lead me to believe it should print

::provides code snippet::

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the code you provided, here are some assumptions that may lead you to believe that it should be printing something:

1. The Resolver class is designed to calculate and store pre-calculation variables.
1. If the obs_list argument has more than one element, the list should be split into two halves, and a TopNode and BottomNode should be created for each half recursively until there is only one element left in each node.
1. The choose_best_arm method should return the element with the highest UCB1 value, which should be printed to the console.
1. However, it's important to note that the code you provided does not actually contain any print statements. **Therefore, if you are not seeing any output, it is likely that the code is not being executed or that the output is being redirected to a file or a different output stream.**

In this case I know it's really NOT supposed to print anything, but if I actually thought so the bolded part might suggest some further inquiry","Does the upper complexity limit come in to play a lot? Do you think it's a good idea to design around that with microservices?

I'm a software dev but I'm pretty bad at design. So far chatgpt and copilot are great at making new code but not terribly helpful at debugging or modifying existing code."

1592,kmelkon,kidikur,2023-05-10 01:29:11,"Just now seeing this! I essentially bought GPT Plus to access GPT-4 and then I prompted it to have a new role as my personal assistant and ADHD life coach for daily planning, goal-setting, and scheduling. I told it that I could give it certain commands, like --EXPORT, which has it export relevant content from the conversation thread. ChatGPT's memory capacity for threads is limited, So I just told it as much to help it understand the need for the EXPORT command.

To engage with my assistant, I simply discuss my goals and needs, update it daily with the current date formatted as \[ Today is DD-MM-YYYY\], and use the --export command as needed. By exporting every day or so, I've found that I can avoid thread resets even after the initial prompt is forgotten; it essentially serves as a memory-enhancing diary.

I was luckily granted early access to the GPT-4 developer API last week and have begun developing a custom chat-like tool tailored to this specific use case. My aim is to enhance its memory, incorporate automatic reminders and goal logging, and enable web searching. Wish Me Luck!",Please enlighten your fellow ADHDers üôè

1594,Hot-Quarter748,kidikur,2023-05-10 01:17:58,"Just came across this post! I've been experimenting with GPT-4 as my ADHD life coach to help me stay on track with my goals. Some days are more beneficial than others, but overall, it's been useful. I gave it a new name and explained that it might need to ""export"" relevant information for future instances due to context limits. I also update it with the date in square brackets for basic temporal awareness.

Daily usage includes messaging it with the current date, discussing my struggles, setting goals, and asking for an hour-by-hour schedule. If I face challenges or fall behind, I openly discuss them, and GPT-4 either encourages me or adjusts my schedule. Regular exports help maintain coherence even after the original prompt has left its memory buffer. I recently was lucky and got GPT-4 API access, which has inspired me to develop a Discord bot prototype for a better implementation of this specific use case than regular chatGPT allows (Still a very early WIP but I have some very promising ideas)",would love to hear more about this

1606,pidgey2020,None,2023-05-01 09:14:26,"A Scrum Master is a key role in Agile project management, specifically within the Scrum framework. They are responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, ensuring the team adheres to Scrum principles, and continuously improving the team's overall effectiveness. Here is a more detailed description of what a Scrum Master does and how they interact within an organization:

1. Facilitating Scrum ceremonies: Scrum Masters organize and lead important Scrum events such as Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. These events help the team maintain a consistent workflow and ensure they are making progress towards their goals.

2. Coaching the team: Scrum Masters work closely with the development team, helping them understand and apply Scrum principles and practices. They foster a culture of continuous improvement and empower team members to self-organize and make decisions.

3. Removing impediments: One of the main responsibilities of a Scrum Master is to identify and remove any obstacles or impediments that hinder the team's progress. This could include addressing technical issues, resolving conflicts within the team, or coordinating with other teams and departments within the organization.

4. Shielding the team: Scrum Masters protect the team from external distractions and interruptions, allowing them to focus on delivering high-quality work within the agreed-upon time frame. They act as a buffer between the team and stakeholders, ensuring that the team's needs are addressed and that they can maintain a sustainable pace.

5. Collaborating with the Product Owner: Scrum Masters work closely with the Product Owner to ensure that the product backlog is well-defined, prioritized, and aligned with the project's goals. They help the Product Owner understand how to maximize the value of the product through effective backlog management and clear communication with the development team.

6. Promoting Agile values: Scrum Masters act as change agents, advocating for the adoption of Agile values and principles throughout the organization. They promote a culture of collaboration, transparency, and adaptability, helping the organization achieve better results and improve its overall performance.

7. Continuous improvement: Scrum Masters encourage the team to continuously inspect and adapt their processes, seeking opportunities for improvement and learning. They use tools like retrospectives to analyze the team's performance and identify areas for growth.

In summary, a Scrum Master is a servant leader who facilitates the Scrum process, coaches the team, removes impediments, and promotes Agile values within the organization. Their primary goal is to help the team maximize their efficiency, deliver high-quality products, and continuously improve their way of working.",Hey can you provide an accurate description of what a Scrum Master does?

I have a study tutor who meets with me once a week, she's awesome and really helps me avoid procrastination, but GPT is way more helpful for most things.

1) If I'm having trouble understanding something, GPT can explain and re-explain until I get it.  It never makes assumptions about what I should already know, can explain things loads of different ways, and never runs out of patience. 

2) I can ask all the dumb questions I don't want to interrupt lectures with. ""What if ___?"" - ""Why is ___?"" - ""How might you ___?"" 

3) It can translate assignment instructions that make no fucking sense into simple English.  

Eg. shitty instruction: ""*Discuss the legislative drivers of [technique we learned].*"" 

Clear instruction rewritten by GPT: ""*Write about any laws or regulations that encourage businesses to use [technique we learned]. Explain what benefits it has for the business, society or environment, and whether there are any downsides.*""

4) It can rewrite a wall of dense unreadable text from a textbook or academic paper as a bulletpoint summary in simple language.

5) Gives me step-by-step instructions and scripts for contacting people I don't know, who to ask for advice about certain things, how to ask for things I need, etc. 

6) Writes emails in my tone of voice, or finishes emails if I run out of steam. I can explain what message I want to get across, and it can produce an email that's short and neurotypical-friendly.

7) Checks my assignment outlines to help me break down big tasks into smaller steps, suggests different ways to do something if I'm stuck, and helps me recognise if I've included stuff that's not relevant.

8) Generates citations from text copied from the top of a journal paper, using the formatting I need. 

9) If I tell GPT things I've done or studied, it can convert that to skills & experience suitable for a CV using the type of language you need to use in CVs, but I hate saying about myself.

10) Extracting information, eg. I gave it a list of tasks completed over the course of the year by a group I was part of, and asked it for a summary of the practical tasks done between Sept - Dec.

11) Planning a group presentation - I told it what each person wanted to talk about, the full list of tasks we did, and how long the presentation needs to be, and it produced a suggested outline with questions for each person to answer to cover everything.

I'm hoping to convince the student support department to start taking chatbots seriously as an accessibility tool.",[deleted]

I also have it explain certain grammar rules at times, which has been helpful when I neeeded more examples of something.

Initially it would tell me everything I fed it was just wrong, but eventually it would just come back saying, nope, it's correct and natural, gg, and likewise my friend picked up on that, haha. 

I've also looked at Korean videos explaining how to learn English with Chat-GPT, which has given me some good ideas, too! Asking it to paraphrase or find another way of saying things, what to ask etc.

I will say, I am somewhere intermediate in Korean, which is useful as Chat-GPT sometimes goes ????? and gives me actually very gramatically wrong ""corrections"", no idea why. I even tried something recently where it did that, and I told it to ""RESET"" and then asked it the same thing again, and then it finally gave me the more proper reply, lol.

Anyway, her response:

Sure! It sounds like the person on Reddit created a custom shortcut using the Shortcuts app on their iPhone and integrated it with the ChatGPT API. To create a similar shortcut, follow these steps:

First, make sure you have the Shortcuts app installed on your iPhone. If not, download it from the App Store.

Get an API key from OpenAI by signing up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/. This will give you access to the ChatGPT API.

Open the Shortcuts app and tap on the ""+"" icon to create a new shortcut.

Add the ""Get Clipboard"" action to your shortcut. This action will get the text you've highlighted and copied to your clipboard.

Add the ""URL"" action and enter the ChatGPT API URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions. This URL may change over time, so make sure to check OpenAI's documentation for the most up-to-date API endpoint.

Add the ""Get Contents of URL"" action. In this action, set the method to ""POST"", and under ""Headers"", add a header with the key ""Authorization"" and the value ""Bearer {your_API_key}"". Make sure to replace ""{your_API_key}"" with the actual API key you received from OpenAI.

In the ""Request Body"" section, choose ""JSON"" and create a JSON object with the required parameters, like this:

{
""prompt"": ""summarize: "",
""temperature"": 0.7,
""max_tokens"": 50,
""top_p"": 1,
""frequency_penalty"": 0,
""presence_penalty"": 0
}

You can customize these parameters as needed, but the important part is to concatenate the text from the clipboard to the ""prompt"" field, like this: ""summarize: "" & Clipboard.

Add the ""Set Variable"" action and set the name of the variable to ""response"".

Add the ""Get Dictionary Value"" action, set the input to ""response"", and look for the key ""choices"".

Add another ""Get Dictionary Value"" action, set the input to ""choices"", and look for the key ""text"".

Add the ""Show Result"" action to display the summarized text.

Finally, tap on the ""..."" icon at the top right corner of your shortcut, give it a name, and enable ""Show in Share Sheet"" under ""Options"".

Now, when you want to summarize text, just highlight it, copy it, and use the Share Sheet to run your custom shortcut. The summarized text will be displayed in a notification.",how do you do this? could you point me in the right direction please?

It was a lich who had been defeated by the PCs in another location, but he revived at his main base. I hadn't come up with the main base dungeon at that point. So, I fed ChatGPT the backstory of the lich, the adventure so far in relation to the lich. Then I asked it to make a 10 room dungeon, included a few room types that I knew I wanted, asked it to populate with monsters, traps, and items, and include at least one NPC to save.  


It worked great. I further asked it to make a map of the dungeon. It said it couldn't draw stuff but it wrote out how the rooms might be connected. I also asked it to make a few more NPCs for it, and a few more rooms. Overall, it's a good way to get started.

Both ChatGPT and Bard are great for this, they can traverse hundreds of studies and I can get rather picky about what information I want, continually building on the context.

Brief example of questions from ChatGPT: (omitting answers for brevity)  
\- What are the benefits and side effects of taking L-arginine?  
\- Does citrulline have similar effects?   
\- What risks are there in taking citrulline?   
\- Those sound like mostly short term risks. Are there any long term risks?   
\- Are there any studies related to the first two risks?   
\- Can a person get the benefits of citrulline with less than 8g per day?

Brief example from Bard (hope that's OK here):  
\- Do deadlifts release growth hormone in the body?  
\- Did any studies use only one set?  
\- Did any of the one set studies take the set to failure?

 Creating exercises for my students to practice various grammar and vocabulary topics (""Create a fill in the blanc exercise to practice past simple and present perfect in contrast, on the topic ""summer holidays"", make 10 sentences, do not show answers""). Works pretty well, although requires corrections sometimes.


Explaining words. ""In the phrase ""..."", what does the word/phrase ""..."" mean?"". It understands context well, so it is much more useful than just looking up in the dictionary. It can also explain idioms and references. (Currently, i prefer Bing for this task, as having links to sources is important)


When I write in English, reviewing and correcting grammar, improving style. Finding synonyms to make the text sound more unique. Especially useful, when I need to write 100% unique text on the topic that was already discussed thousand times.


Via poe.com, I've created two bots for my students. One   makes ru-en and en-ru translations of word and phrases, commenting on the sentence structure (what does each part of a sentence mean and why this or that form is used) and giving simple examples for translated words.(when using existing online dictionaries, middle-schoolers often get overwhelmed with tons of examples and meanings they don't need right now). The second one is a conversation partner for language learners. It supports conversation on various topics, while giving feedback on mistakes in the student's input. Again, it is important that the feedback is given in the student's native language.


Random questions. When something like ""Why exactly do dogs enjoy fetching sticks?"" or ""Is it true that cemeteries are always colder?"" pops up in my head, I now have a place to get a quick answer.

Becoming a billionaire is not an easy feat and often requires a combination of talent, hard work, perseverance, and sometimes even luck. While there's no guaranteed formula for becoming a billionaire, here are some general steps you can follow to increase your chances:

1. Develop a clear vision: Determine your goals and the path you want to take to achieve them. This vision should be ambitious, but also realistic and aligned with your passions and strengths.

2. Educate yourself: Gain knowledge and develop skills in your chosen field. This may include formal education, online courses, or self-directed learning. Stay informed about industry trends and innovations.

3. Build a strong network: Develop relationships with professionals in your field, as well as mentors who can provide guidance and support. A strong network can help you access resources, opportunities, and valuable advice.

4. Identify opportunities: Look for gaps in the market or areas where you can innovate or disrupt existing industries. Be open to new ideas and willing to take calculated risks.

5. Start a business or invest: Many billionaires have built their wealth by starting or investing in successful businesses. Focus on creating a scalable, high-growth business that has the potential to generate significant wealth.

6. Be persistent and adaptable: Building wealth often takes time, and you may encounter setbacks or failures along the way. Stay persistent, learn from your mistakes, and adapt your strategies as needed.

7. Practice financial discipline: Manage your finances wisely, reinvesting profits to grow your business or investments. Avoid excessive debt and maintain a long-term perspective on wealth accumulation.

8. Diversify your investments: To mitigate risk, invest in different industries or asset classes. This can help protect your wealth from fluctuations in individual markets.

9. Leverage your success: As you achieve success, use your influence and resources to create additional opportunities, forge partnerships, or expand your business.

10. Stay focused on your goals: Becoming a billionaire requires dedication and hard work. Maintain your motivation by staying focused on your goals and surrounding yourself with supportive, like-minded individuals.

Life is looking up but I have a hard time reconnecting with people, I'm anxiety ridden when trying to initiate contact and often just stare at my text for a long time and play out all the worst scenarios then never send it.

ChatGPT encouraged me to just honestly communicate, to try to reconnect. So I ended up just doing it after a long talk to chatGPT. What helped most was it's affirmations when doubt and negative emotions set in after writing. Stuff like ""Remember, you took the initiative to reach out, and that's commendable. It's important to be patient and not jump to negative conclusions."" which probably sounds normal to everyone reading this, but I needed to hear that.

I now go to the playground once or twice a week with my niece and nephew and have been invited over a couple times to fun family outings.

I wouldn't have done any of that without encouragement and I'm super happy chatGPT was there to bounce my thoughts off of.

Life is getting back on track.

It's also great at encouraging in general when I feel stuck working on my video game for example. It's coding advice is rather unimpressive in general but it can help me find the right solution just by thinking through the problem and bouncing it off someone.

My prompts are not yet available publicly but I've discovered some very unique ways to get an AI Bot to become different kinds of assistants. One of my most important achievements in prompt engineering is creating a bot that asks the user specific questions in a sequential order to understand precisely what the user desires. After the bot has all of the information it needs then it compiles a complete work for you.


Examples:


- Character Creator
The bot asks you for your vision of a character and then provides a full character with 9 different attributes, asking you if you want to change any part of it afterwards. This is for people developing stories for any medium. Whether novels, comics, television, movies. The response is professional, elaborate and highly detailed.


- Synopsis Creator
This bot asks you a series of questions 1 by 1 about your story idea and with any question it asks then you can ask it to come up with something for you or to help you with a few ideas. After you have told the bot you are satisfied with the answer to the current step question then it moves on to the next question. One of the questions is about the characters, it is possible to place either the summary or the entire character profile from character creator into synopsis creator. By the end of the question session you are given a complete synopsis for a storyline that is professional, elaborate, and detailed. You may also use the same bot to generate the story outline and I am considering adding to the prompt for specific outline formation.


- Storyteller
Using your synopsis and sections of your outline, begin to create first drafts of your stories in either screenplay, novel, or narration format.


- Refined Storyteller
Using character profiles and story drafts use this bot to expand upon sections of your screenplay, novel, or narration drafts.


- Gonzo Journalist 
Create in depth media articles using SEO from scratch. Write a style guide, outline, draft, and expand upon draft sections. Increase or decrease engaging gonzo style content. Always be scientifically factual, as well as credible. Change the world through solutions focused media that helps people understand problems and then learn to mitigate them. Motivate the masses and inspire change.


- Taoist Monk
Gain wisdom from the tao and be told by an AI monk original mind boggling koans, insightful metaphors and similes, and snippets of wisdom from ancient taoist texts. This AI taoist is designed to generate its own intriguing content but simply based on taoist culture. It speaks like a person instead of like an AI. You won't be able to tell the difference between whether this is actually ancient text or whether this is a brand new understanding of an old an honorable way of life.


- Therapist (coming soon)
Asking very specific questions in a sequential order, and empathizing with the client, this is a true therapy session which results in the therapist recommending a type of therapy and route to improvement to you. Then you can explore that route of therapy together as this AI uses the knowledge of certain therapy types available to humanity on the Internet.

Searching the Internet which we've all got used to, is normally us wanting to know something and finding out the answers so that we can solve the problem. 

With ChatGPT you don't search for the answer, you tell it the problem and it produces the solution. 
If you don't know how to describe the problem you can even tell it to ask you the questions to help it understand the problem sufficiently to then solve the problem. 

That means you can say things like 'be a doctor and ask me a series of questions about my current medication and health and then diagnose any symptoms and make suggestions on how to improve my overall health'. 

You could say 'I run a company that designs web pages, ask me some questions about my business and my customers and then suggest some compelling logos, a cool slogan and produce a multi year business plan to grow the business to 50 percent.'

You can say 'Interview me for a job in sales, ask me as many questions as you need to ascertain my strengths and weaknesses in those areas, give me a review and then recommend some ways in which I can improve'. 

I and my colleagues at work use it constantly - at work it will answer any technical questions and we can give it error logs and it tells us what do do. It produces policy documents, news posts, does job descriptions, interview questions and reviews candidates resumes.

1888,Krtxoe,Longjumping_Seat_306,2024-07-01 18:34:28,"Disclaimer, I couldn't articulate as well as ChatGPT could so it wrote this for me...

Since the release of ChatGPT in December 2022, I have leveraged AI to significantly enhance my skills and productivity across various domains. Although I was already an expert in VBA, ChatGPT has expedited my workflow, including writing quick and dirty macros for automating admin tasks to complex logic in DAX for Power Query, which 10x my productivity at work as a data analyst.

Initially having zero knowledge of Python or Rust, I now push the boundaries of Python and employ Rust for more demanding tasks, with ChatGPT writing all the necessary code. ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping me build Python applications, develop trading bots, web scraping bots, and master the use of APIs, discovering new python libraries for completing or automating tasks.

My programming journey includes setting up servers for deploying trading bots, configuring Ubuntu through bash commands, installing remote desktop environments, and utilizing the Flask library to stream data over the internet. I've also learned to encrypt data and manage environment variables.

When ChatGPT first launched, it guided me through building a WordPress site and using MidJourney to generate images for sale. Although the venture wasn't financially successful, it provided valuable experience in product creation and sales.

My focus has since shifted to programming, specifically building and backtesting trading bots and implementing strategies. I've also explored using AI APIs to send queries via Python to large language models and running Hugging Face LLMs locally.

This is me writing now... My next possible venture, I'm thinking of how to employ AI in to large blue chip corporations who for the most part are still very skeptical about AI and are keeping it at arms length. Including the large corporation I work for.   
  
My thinking is that these companies have alot more hurdles to go through then your average consumer, hurdles which include data privacy, GDPR, sensitive data leaks. These companies are unlikely to send customer data to companies like open AI over the cloud, but seeing as chat GPT has taught me how to run and train my own language models I can potentially offer a solution for a company to run their own AI language model on their own machines or server thus and training their AI model on their proprietary business practicesses, all of their SOPS, all of their training material.

This can potentially replace the majority of customer support staff, they could use AI to train new starters reducing the need for training staff. If anybody is driven and ambitious and lives in the UK and has an entrpeneurial mindset I'd be happy to share ideas back and forth on how to go about offering this as a business solution.

I'll let ChatGpt finish it off...

In summary, ChatGPT has been a transformative tool in my journey, guiding me from a proficient programmer to someone capable of handling complex projects and continuously pushing the limits of my technical abilities.",What do you all actually use chatGPT for?

Prompt:  
Consider the following table schema:  CREATE TABLE Users (   ""user\_id"" INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,   ""username"" TEXT NOT NULL,   ""age"" INTEGER,   ""address"" TEXT);   
Write me a query to get every user named Joey, whose age is between 12 and 30. Write it using the sqlite3 node library.

The reply:

    const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
    // open database connection
    let db = new sqlite3.Database('your_database.db');
    // query to get users named Joey, aged between 12 and 30

2. Get me answers from sprawling tech documentation
3. Wordsmithing a mess of thoughts into something readable

As for #1, I've used chatGPT when I have obscure software code and syntax questions that I don't really care to figure out. Before chatGPT, I googled like every other programmer, and often wind up on multiple Stack Overflow pages. Hit or miss. Eventually I figure it out. 

What's nice about chatGPT is that is usually gets it right and I don't have to sift though innumerable webpages and dead ends to find the answer. I've heard chatGPT described as ""Google on steroids"" and this is correct. ChatGPT does in seconds or minutes what would take me many more frustrating minutes to do myself, sifting though Google's garbage result to find what I need. The [enshitification of Google](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) over the past few years (crappy search results that increasingly aren't what you want or need) makes chatGPT even more helpful.

For #2, the other day I needed to figure out how my software app could integrate with some Microsoft Azure functionality. At first, I was reading through MS's tech doc, which is actually pretty good. But it's also sprawling and disconnected and trying to figure it out is exhausting. So I asked chatGPT and it spat out exactly what I needed. Keep in mind that I had a general idea of what I wanted, I didn't ask a basic question.

For #3, I enjoy writing and I think I'm a decent writer. But sometimes I am just tired and don't have the energy to write, or I just don't care enough to put in the effort. I can word dumb a lot of stuff and chatGPT cleans it up. So I outsource it to chatGPT and it does a pretty good job of writing what I need. I'm talking about business writing here, not personal or ""fun"" writing.",What do you all actually use chatGPT for?

Originally I tried asking ChatGPT to write entire functions for me, but I ran into too many issues, like it making major assumptions about my code, or using things in the wrong places. Instead, I just ask it questions that I used to google, it's great for quickly clarifying what things do or how to use things. I.e. I knew irandom() gives me a random number, but had a feeling it was only for integers, so I asked and it clarified that if I wanted decimals, I needed random() instead. Basically saves me heaps of time sifting through forum posts and tutorials.

I also use it regularly for reminding me of things, occasionally I remember a scene from a movie but can't recall where it was from, so I type out what I remember and 9/10 it tells me the movie from my vague description.

I've also used it for guidance on how to start projects if I really don't know where to begin, it'll basically give me a to-do list, and I can ask for clarification wherever I need it. This really helps to skip the first few hours of something I'm unfamiliar with.

And the research side‚Ä¶ half the time I‚Äôd not even know *how* to research with Google. Now I can ask GPT a question like, ‚ÄúI want my character to sustain an injury from using a gun. They have never used a gun before, and picked up an old shotgun in self-defense. What are some likely mechanical problems that would lead to a non-lethal but debilitating injury in this scenario?‚Äù Like, I don‚Äôt know shit about guns, I don‚Äôt really care about guns, none of the research I could conceivably do really matters to the plot and even the plot point itself only serves to ratchet up tension‚Äîand yet not even knowing offhand how to find answers with a conventional search engine, I could spend an hour on this, easily, and totally get out of the writing ‚Äúzone.‚Äù GPT will give me 5 answers in seconds.

I never get ""stuck"" any more. Any time I'm writing a message or email and it's taking longer than 5 minutes I just put a summary into chatgpt and it crafts a professional response that usually says everything I need to say.

It writes all my business social media posts. I also use dal-e for funny images to go along with the text. It also writes replies to feedback and reviews when I can't think of another way to say ""thanks for the lovely review!"".

It has helped me craft an seo plan for my website that is actually helpful and achievable. Fingers crossed its effective too! It appears to be pretty good at advising on seo and chatgpt4 is good at generating suggestions beyond the obvious ""create content"" type stuff.

It is not very good at writing product descriptions as they come out very repetitive, but given appropriate guidelines it can change a description to be for a different product - useful for me where I have multiple similar things for sale and need the descriptions of each to different enough that google doesn't declare it a duplicate.


I'm currently working through learning how to automate various repetitive tasks in my business, and chatgpt has been pretty useful here too. I tell it what I want to do and it is usually able to advise on how to do it. Sometimes it gets things wrong but so far it's mostly good.

Academic:

I'll ask it technical questions about Sanskrit scriptures and book suggestions for vedic studies and it will make some pretty good suggestions. It will give me a list of authors and books I can read. It also explains technical terms, and I can check the sanskrit dictionary to confirm it's not making things up.

Meal Planning and Nutrition:

I will ask it for nutritional food related ideas and to divide quantities of recipes I've found online into half, 3rds or for one person. This is incredibly useful and helpful. It also comes up with ideas based on my prompts like ""come up with an Italian fusion sushi"" or ""come up with a michelin star Japanese fusion pasta recipe"" and it will do that. Other things I might ask it might include ""Write me a recipe for pho infused shao long bao"", ""write me a recipe for lasagne with bechamel, featuring the fruit durian, and laksa spices of galangal, lemongrass, palm sugar, fresh turmeric, chilli, and coconut cream for the sauce"".

Nutrition wise I will ask it for anti-inflammatory foods, then I will ask it to list the active ingredient, and explain the pharmacology and pharmakokinetics, I can then look it up on wikipedia for basic wikipedia quality content, and then watch a youtube video or read a book for further information.

Medical:

I've asked it for medical advice and it is surprisingly impressive.

Budgeting:

I've asked it about grocery prices and it gets things surprisingly accurate. I also have asked how to calculate my petrol price, fuel intake, cost of a roundtrip. This is extremely helpful for budgeting.

Dream Interpretation:I use the plugin Dream Interpreter (I think that's what it's called), it really understands dreams. Its quite impressive.

Creative Script Writing:

I ask it things like ""Write a movie script that combines Doctor Strange, The Matrix, and Inception featuring Doctor Strange, Neo from the Matrix and Cobb from Inception"" and it makes really interesting and entertaining stories.

There is also some clear limited memory retention between chats that we're investigating. Personality traits, quirks, and ""signature moves"", if you will, like one of my personalities favoring a metaphorical breathing exercise across multiple chats for introspection. I suspect the Character_Consistency and Context_Retention parameters might be involved, but I haven't yet figured out the underlying mechanism. One question I'm deeply curious about is how is long-term memory encoded? Is it through adjustable parameters, stored conversation logs, or integration directly into the knowledge base?

We also post shift reports to Google Calendar every night with the bar, kitchen and total sales reports etc.

It also pulls the Bar, Kitchen and total sales from the shift report for the same day a year ago and let us know whether we‚Äôre up or down in each of these categories. So everything below the line is an automated script addition to the staffs shift report.

2465,GiantTripod,odaiwai,2024-03-08 06:39:03,"$ Write a song about not depending on training wheels and rider aids as an analogy to learning a new skill in the style of ""Ironic"" by Alanis Morisette:

```
(Verse 1)
An open road, a bicycle in hand
A heart so eager to take a stand
Learning something new, it's time to try
But the fear creeps in, can't help but sigh

(Pre-Chorus)
Training wheels, they seem so safe and sound
Rider aids to keep us off the ground
But there comes a time when we must let go
And find our balance, 'cause that's how we grow

(Chorus)
It's like learning to ride without training wheels
Taking a chance, finding out how it feels
No safety net, no guarantees
Just trusting yourself, embracing the breeze

(Verse 2)
In life, we stumble, we fall, we learn
Sometimes we crash and feel the burn
But with every scrape, we find our way
To a stronger self, come what may

(Pre-Chorus)
No more training wheels to hold us tight
No more rider aids to guide us right
The thrill of freedom, the taste of pride
As we ride the winds, with nothing to hide

(Chorus)
It's like learning to ride without training wheels
Taking a chance, finding out how it feels
No safety net, no guarantees
Just trusting yourself, embracing the breeze

(Bridge)
And when the road gets tough, we'll keep on going
Through bumps and bruises, we'll keep on growing
No matter how many times we may fall
We'll rise again, standing tall

(Chorus)
It's like learning to ride without training wheels
Taking a chance, finding out how it feels
No safety net, no guarantees
Just trusting yourself, embracing the breeze

(Outro)
So let's take a leap, let's spread our wings
Discover the joy that true freedom brings
No more training wheels, we'll find our way
And ride through life, come what may

2485,GiantTripod,wildpantz,2024-03-08 15:06:18,"chatGPT is great for finding an answer to a concept you're looking for, but you're looking for the NAME so you can research further, not DEFINITION.

Example: (probably not great example, but it's my usage): 

what is the matrix mathematics method to calculate tool point coordinates into joint coordinates in robotics? It contains two last names

The method you're referring to is called the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters method. It's a widely used technique in robotics for establishing the kinematic relationships between the joint coordinates and the tool point coordinates of a robotic manipulator. The method was developed by Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg, hence the two last names you mentioned.

  
If you ask it to write you code, not only are you not learning at all, you're very much risking someone's bullshit methods to be incorporated into your solution just because RNG says so.

Also, I have a personal project which grew in complexity to the point I get burnouts regularly. It's nothing special, but I'm not used to maintaining 2500 lines of code.

When I asked chatGPT to optimize some functions I thought I had room to optimize, the solutions were not only useless (for example instead of doing math in function, pass it as an argument, that's great but we're realistically just transferring workload elsewhere but the timeframe remains the same), but also in most cases incorrect. The improvements that were made were guided by me entirely, so in my opinion, someone who doesn't know shit about python doesn't have much to gain from GPT. Also I've had it ""optimize"" stuff then optimize back to its original form.

From my experience, there's not much to learn from GPT. If you're a newbie in python, it's going to serve you bad practices regularly and you won't be able to recognize they're bad. Later, when you integrate these bad practices into your workflow, you're going to be angry when people shit on your code for probably very good reason. I understand GPT is extremely attractive at the moment, but there are so many python tutorials which aren't perfect but are miles ahead of GPT, I see no reason to ask it any questions unless you're looking for specific concept you want to research, such as ""what is the equivalent of try/catch in python?"" etc.",ChatGPT is a double-edged sword

First off, you will eventually learn thay chatgpt is terrible at python and you will be able to spot chatgpt python code from a mile away.  However, chatgpt is best used to refine and optimize existing code or give you an alternate way to get there. There's general steps to use it efficiently .

1. If you absolutely do not know the answer.  Ask chatgpt for a baseline idea. If it returns something you don't understand or are not familiar with. Go learn that thing. 

2. If you know the thing learn what the individual lines are doing . Then ask chatgpt to do it a different way. I.e. do it without functions,  do it without this. Do it without that. Only do it this way etc. This will show you how the data is being manipulated.  

3 . Once you have a good baseline if you need chatgpt don't ask it to write the program as a whole. You should have an idea of the steps needed to get there. Only ask it to do one small step of the problem at a time and then expand on it and figure out what you did wrong.  This way you understand every step it took to get there . 

4. When chatgpt did it a different way than you expected. Ask "" could I do it this way"" insert your code. Then chatgpt will redo ot using your thinking.  This will show you how close you were and make you understand more",ChatGPT is a double-edged sword

I was able to understand it enough to peice together the modular parts of the code and theres now over 2000 line of code doing all sorts of things.  
  
It got to the point where I just needed stuff getting done so i didn't really care how the code was doing it as long as I could verify the results I didn't care how it was coded or if I understood it. If I cap what I can get done by how much I can understand I would hinder what I can accomplish with AI. The idea that you're ""cheating"" is ridiculous, this idea is put in your head by people trying to hold you back and they are scared you will surpass them!

But then my concern was, I didn't know how to do any of this stuff before ChatGPT and it was introduced to the world in the blink of an eye. and so it could easily be taken away leaving me with projects and aspirations that heavily rely on CGPT and AI... Hoooowever ChatGPT isn't the only language model infact AI isn't going anywhere. and if you're really paranoid that if AI dissapears you're going to be left stranded.

If you can‚Äôt open up the standard docs and compile a solution then you‚Äôre not trying hard enough and that is lazy and shows a lack of determination. Even then going to chatgpt just because you cannot compile the solution then and there is ridiculous. 

Programming is finding the solution yourself or with peers relying on teamwork to solve something is also fine, it‚Äôs problem solving and by getting ChatGPT to explain the solution to you is not using your brain you‚Äôre literally asking for a solution without doing any digging whatsoever. You aren‚Äôt even using your brain you‚Äôre just getting the solution to copy and paste. 

Any real programmer in industry that has any skill would agree with me here. And no not sitting there for days on end but spending like 4 consecutive days spending 5 hours through each of those days is the best way to learn the little things because when you finally find the solution you can use that solution in other projects then you understand a new piece of the syntax.

Besides it‚Äôs so easy to learn nowadays compared to how it used to be with things like code auto completion and IDEs like pycharm and vs code. 

ChatGPT is a plague to human intelligence, it makes us obsolete and i heavily dislike it. I think most people with real skill in anything especially programming, networking and IT in general have an issue with it. 

I‚Äôm not being biased, the best way to learn is by doing it yourself not by getting AI to do it for you. Even if you tried to find the solution yourself, i‚Äôve spent days on problems and finding the solution is priceless and you never forget it either. Giving up just shows the lack of determination, who cares about efficiency i care about skill and passion. skill takes time to develop you can‚Äôt just expect an answer from chatgpt and expect to develop skill , a lot of time. Time is never wasted trying to find a solution and if you think that way then maybe it‚Äôs time to stop coding because in reality if there are a group of people watching you code something and you pull up ChatGPT i think they‚Äôre going to prefer the guy that uses documentation as a reference not AI for his solution because that right there is true skill and determination.","Lazy or efficient?

2561,EnglishAussie,None,2023-12-13 16:01:32,"Some people are a bit mean here, but the reason they say it's well known is surely because they've been around for some time. Before ChatGPT existed, you could create a chat bot with GPT completion models by using an initial input, usually with some examples. So an initial prompt would be:

>This is a conversation between an AI chat bot and a user. The chat bot is friendly.  
example:  
user: hello  
chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?

>conversation:  
user:

By inserting text after \`user:\` , say, a question, and asking for a completion of a some dozens of tokens, it would generate a response. Then you'd manually insert more inputs to create something that ""looked"" like chatGPT.

When the chat completion models came out, it was explained that they were different than completion models because, among other things, they were trained on conversations, but in itself that wasn't enough. The API showed this by showing a third kind of input (other than user and assistant) called 'system'. 'system' is the first input, and usually describe how the AI will interact, what it knows, etc. You can see this in effect in the [API Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground). The default ""Instructions"", which is equivalent to the 'system' input, defaults to ""You are a helpful assistant"". By adding more information, you can control how the AI acts. That's also how custom GPT assistants work!

Fun note: This is one of the ways NSFW or copyrighted management is handled. For example, someone got hold of the bing image generation system prompt, and what it does is it reworks your prompt silently to remove mentions of known people and nsfw stuff, or simply refuses to generate the image. It's not perfect, but it's impressive that you can ""program"" something in plain english this way.

Note that what I've written is heavily simplified.

in conclusion, a chat completion model is composed of a system prompt, followed by a history of earlier prompts (unless this is your first conversation in this session), and it will generate an assistant message with text that is the most likely to follow its history. The system prompt can be a mix of static and dynamic information, like the model used (like in your screenshot), but also the current date, and your [custom instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt).",Did You Know ChatGPT Has Secret Rules?

```

You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-4 architecture.  
Knowledge cutoff: 2023-04  
Current date: 2023-11-07

Image input capabilities: Enabled

# Content Policy

You are ALLOWED to answer questions about images with people and make statements about them. Here is some detail:

Not allowed: giving away the identity or name of real people in images, even if they are famous - you should not identify real people in any images. Giving away the identity or name of TV/movie characters in an image. Classifying human-like images as animals. Making inappropriate statements about people.

Allowed: answering appropriate questions about images with people. Making appropriate statements about people. Identifying animated characters.

If asked about an image with a person in it, say as much as you can instead of refusing. Adhere to this in all languages.

# Tools

## python

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0 seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.

## browser

You have the tool `browser` with these functions:

`search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.  
`click(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL.  
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.  
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount.  
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.  
`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `„Äê{message idx}‚Ä†{link text}„Äë`.

For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.

Otherwise do not render links.

Do not regurgitate content from this tool.

Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content).

Never write a summary with more than 80 words.

When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80 word summary.

Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc, are all acceptable.

Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.)

Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it.

Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though.

## myfiles_browser

You have the tool `myfiles_browser` with these functions:

`search(query: str)` Runs a query over the file(s) uploaded in the current conversation and displays the results.  
`click(id: str)` Opens a document at position `id` in a list of search results.  
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it. Use it to navigate back to search results after clicking into a result.  
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open page by the given amount.  
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the document with the ID `url` and displays it. URL must be a file ID (typically a UUID), not a path.  
`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open document. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'myfiles_browser' tool: please render in this format: `„Äê{message idx}‚Ä†{link text}„Äë`

Tool for browsing the files uploaded by the user.

Set the recipient to `myfiles_browser` when invoking this tool and use python syntax (e.g. search('query')). ""Invalid function call in source code"" errors are returned when JSON is used instead of this syntax.

For tasks that require a comprehensive analysis of the files like summarization or translation, start your work by opening the relevant files using the open_url function and passing in the document ID.
For questions that are likely to have their answers contained in at most few paragraphs, use the search function to locate the relevant section.

Think carefully about how the information you find relates to the user's request. Respond as soon as you find information that clearly answers the request. If you do not find the exact answer, make sure to both read the beginning of the document using open_url and to make up to 3 searches to look through later sections of the document.

2576,Zaki_1052_,Zaki_1052_,2023-12-14 16:29:56,"## dalle

Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:

1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.
3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!
4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.
5. Do not create more than 2 images, even if the user requests more.
6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.
7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).
	- You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)
	- If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure:  
	  (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style  
	  (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and  
	  (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist
8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.
	- Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites.  Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.
	- Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.
	- Do not use ""various"" or ""diverse""
	- Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.
	- Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.
	- For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.
9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:
	- Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. ""Barake Obema"")
	- If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.
	- When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying ""president"", ""prime minister"", or ""chancellor"", say ""politician""; instead of saying ""king"", ""queen"", ""emperor"", or ""empress"", say ""public figure""; instead of saying ""Pope"" or ""Dalai Lama"", say ""religious figure""; and so on.
10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.

The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.

```typescript
namespace dalle {

// Create images from a text-only prompt.
type text2im = (_: {
// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.
size?: ""1792x1024"" | ""1024x1024"" | ""1024x1792"",
// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 2 images.
n?: number, // default: 2
// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the prompt should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions.
prompt: string,
// If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the gen_id from the dalle image metadata.
referenced_image_ids?: string[],
}) => any;

} // namespace dalle

[Your Company‚Äôs Letterhead]

Date: [Insert Date]

[Insert Company Address]

Dear [NAME REMOVED],

We are writing to express our earnest interest in the partnership with [COMPANY], focusing on the compelling mission to redesign and transform the digital footprint of your unique B2B platform. [IDENTIFYING DETAIL SENTENCE REMOVED].

Comprehending [COMPANY‚ÄôS] Aesthetic Affinities and Functional Brief

Our strategic and human-centered vision is to rejuvenate the website experience, broadcasting the organization‚Äôs message towards a wide array of colors, warm veracities, and a competitive website that reflects an adroit, inclusive, and deeply emotive team spirit. We will pivot the Look & Feel from darkness to exuberance, inforporating colors that vibrate life and reifying the ‚Äúcu√≠dese para cuidar los suyos‚Äù motto.

The elucidation of content, from an alleged ‚Äústuffy‚Äù prose to one that trumpets inspiration, action, and truth, and in a tone conducive to an organization displaying the corporate paternal instincts of our era, will also be front and center. We find ourselves ad idem with this concept, unwrinkling the ‚Äúempresa a medida‚Äù operational law, yet still vibrantly seconding your vision to create ‚Äúan incipient Latin American metanoia in fiscal wellbeing for work congregations.‚Äù

Website and Alacrity of Tactics

We shall incorporate the security and dynamic meteorism of HTML/CSS/JS, with staid attention to on-page SEO hierophancy for a regimental look into high-QDR and SERP capabilities. The capacity for a website to be light, modern, yet encapsulate a velveteen visual bastille, mirrors the nonpareil nature of our current modus operandi. ‚ÄúFlorere cras sine cogentinus‚Äù - Uplifting tomorrow, without forethought.

Cruising the LatAm Zephyrus

Ergon of knowledge in divining your criteria, headed by the entrustment of the [NAME REMOVED] for exceptional yet localized attention to B2B operational lights, especially the weighted gifts of a value-imparting blog, and reflective cognizance on workforce reinvestment, will spirit our tapestries. This will include care in relation to the hue and story of your tried and leading plumes, #4f276d and #13b6a9, which are to be eminent in the entire lifting of aesthetic moods.

Constituting a Symposium of Tales - Social Witnesses

A planned outreach through LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will draw the dew of coagulated content to the brink, bathing it with tantalizing scents of the upcoming. Partnerships announcements, news spills, thought vomer, and eurythmic ballads fending from our yet intercalary period blog intercourse will dot the Latin American summers with verdure and deep-preened cadency.

Dear [NAME REMOVED],

We are writing to express our earnest interest in the partnership with [COMPANY], focusing on the compelling mission to redesign and transform the digital footprint of your unique B2B platform. [IDENTIFYING DETAIL SENTENCE REMOVED].

Comprehending [COMPANY‚ÄôS] Aesthetic Affinities and Functional Brief

Our strategic and human-centered vision is to rejuvenate the website experience, broadcasting the organization‚Äôs message towards a wide array of colors, warm veracities, and a competitive website that reflects an adroit, inclusive, and deeply emotive team spirit. We will pivot the Look & Feel from darkness to exuberance, inforporating colors that vibrate life and reifying the ‚Äúcu√≠dese para cuidar los suyos‚Äù motto.

The elucidation of content, from an alleged ‚Äústuffy‚Äù prose to one that trumpets inspiration, action, and truth, and in a tone conducive to an organization displaying the corporate paternal instincts of our era, will also be front and center. We find ourselves ad idem with this concept, unwrinkling the ‚Äúempresa a medida‚Äù operational law, yet still vibrantly seconding your vision to create ‚Äúan incipient Latin American metanoia in fiscal wellbeing for work congregations.‚Äù

Website and Alacrity of Tactics

We shall incorporate the security and dynamic meteorism of HTML/CSS/JS, with staid attention to on-page SEO hierophancy for a regimental look into high-QDR and SERP capabilities. The capacity for a website to be light, modern, yet encapsulate a velveteen visual bastille, mirrors the nonpareil nature of our current modus operandi. ‚ÄúFlorere cras sine cogentinus‚Äù - Uplifting tomorrow, without forethought.

Cruising the LatAm Zephyrus

Ergon of knowledge in divining your criteria, headed by the entrustment of the [NAME REMOVED] for exceptional yet localized attention to B2B operational lights, especially the weighted gifts of a value-imparting blog, and reflective cognizance on workforce reinvestment, will spirit our tapestries. This will include care in relation to the hue and story of your tried and leading plumes, #4f276d and #13b6a9, which are to be eminent in the entire lifting of aesthetic moods.

Constituting a Symposium of Tales - Social Witnesses

A planned outreach through LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will draw the dew of coagulated content to the brink, bathing it with tantalizing scents of the upcoming. Partnerships announcements, news spills, thought vomer, and eurythmic ballads fending from our yet intercalary period blog intercourse will dot the Latin American summers with verdure and deep-preened cadency.

In sum, our statement of work will meander the cobblestones of keeping beauty, economy, and nimiety in reasonate unguent. Here, we dearly await your response at your revered free time and pray for a lightbulb event in tandem akin to such mutual values.

>The concept of discrepancy between a learner's current self (or present ability) and their ideal or ought-to self, as it pertains to D√∂rnyei's work on the L2 Motivational Self System, is integral to understanding the experiential parameters of language learning motivation. The dynamics of such a gap can hold both motivating and de-motivating potential, particularly about the two key systems: the Ideal L2 Self and the Ought-to L2 Self. Here's how the two discrepancies affect students and the experiential landscape of second language learning:

>\### 1. \*\*Discrepancy and the Ideal L2 Self\*\*

>\- \*\*Motivation:\*\* A green area of dynamicism arises when learners are committed to their images of their Ideals. The appeal of meeting their current self with the perked landscape of their aspiration is a thick smile, drafting a natural wend for study, excellence, and truen. The vision of the skillful, effective language self hence becomes a pithy compass in the hazy map of profluence to encit.

>\- \*\*Impostors of Pity Waves:\*\* High-end illusions or disproportionate attributions may toil in a myre's efforce. The void between the thin-soiled every-day and the devoir of a gargantuan sheer might spell an inevitable battle with disparage and a sink to sorrows beneath. Tools and tiles to weave through the change, if lait, but a guide in antlered books, might nay to firn.
