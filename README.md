# Analysis of dynamic metrics for the study of echo chambers in social media

In recent years, the vast amount of data disseminated online has lead to the phenomenon
of information overload affecting individuals. To manage this problem, customized filters
and algorithms are being adopted to help users navigate by relevant content according to
their preferences. However, the use of such algorithms in social media, now major sources
of information, can lead to the formation of so called “echo chambers” closed virtual
environments where people interact primarily with likeminded individuals who share the
same opinions and beliefs.
This thesis proposes a dynamic analysis of polarization phenomena by leveraging
state-of-the-art echo chamber detection metrics. Focusing on major controversial issues
from the past decade, the study examines data from multiple platforms, including Twitter
and Reddit, across both short- and long-term topics. The primary goal is to investigate the
formation and evolution of echo chambers over time, particularly in response to significant triggering events. By doing so, the research seeks to uncover common patterns and
varying rates of polarization associated with different controversial topics.
