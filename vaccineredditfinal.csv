Let me break it down.

You have 4 possible answers, but only two Answers would apply to any one individual.

Group 1: was vaccinated. Regret or not regret.
Group 2: not vaccinated. Regret or not regret.

If you want to know the % of people of one group that regret getting vaccinated you must divid the regret# by the sum of all responses from that group. 31 / (40+31). 

So according to this survey, it‚Äôs 43.6% that regret it.

This question is so poorly set up it is clear this is not a professional survey.

I would also expect to see additional options, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure‚Äù. Forcing someone to make a decision is one way to ruin your study. What if 90% of people were just like meh I don‚Äôt feel strongly and want to answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, but your forced them to make a decision. You loose important context which would easily lead to making the wrong conclusion.

So the person who created this (assuming it‚Äôs not just a complete fabrication) has no idea about survey methods or question creation and structuring the study.

Antivax sentiment is logical after the pharmaceutical industry during covid forever destroyed trust in any future vaccines. Your comment implies antivax sentiment is illogical, when the only illogical position on that topic today would be to still blindly place faith in the efficacy or safety of vaccines.

The name Fauci in his native land means ‚Äúsickle of the harvest‚Äù. We are in a war against unimaginable darkness and covid was just the beginning. There are more viruses to come and much shock and awe all around.

Also The ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù‚Ä¶ its the same as with hiv and aids patients, and its from hiv glyco protein 120. It‚Äôs lowered global IQ points and is killing people short term, medium term, and long term. Seek out and face the actual science (its out there) and do not listen to anyone who told you to take this. That‚Äôs the media or the doctors. The protein is toxic and causes neurodegenerative disorders. The more you get the worse you are and some people‚Äôs bodies have transfected the protein and are creating it within their own cells. It is genetic dependent and you are in a war based on DNA after everyone just handed over all of their‚Äôs (and likely close family members) with every swab and PCR you took.

It kills the immune system, the brain and the heart, and the next one is gonna hit heavier and harder with everyone having compromised immune systems.

Try listening to the people you were trying to put in jail and called crazy, and take responsibility.

There‚Äôs no sense in regret, what‚Äôs done is done and at some point you have to forgive yourself but please take action and do the research to try and get this protein out of your system because despite what the media told you, you are now shedding prion proteins (like Madcow) on the rest of us who did our research, knew the dangers before the vaccine was widely adopted, and are now suffering the consequences  and health effects from our friends and family coming down with cancers and dying left and right. All the while opening ourselves up to more and more exposure because these prions don‚Äôt just go away.

They stay in the environment. Killing them with fire is barely doable because of the temperature‚Äôs needed. As always God and good will win but this was a huge hit to the world. As Ian Malcolm famously said in Jurassic Park ‚Äúlife finds a way‚Äù‚Ä¶ and now we all must do just that. 

Accept that you‚Äôre in a biological war with bloodlines and knighthoods that you‚Äôve likely never heard of and do the right thing the next time. The rest of us really need you to nut up and help us because we all barely made it through the first time.

I sometimes go back and watch highlight reels from all the major media shows and comedy hours that shamed the unvaccinated. It‚Äôs disgusting hearing jimmy Kimmel call for my death if I dont want a mystery juice that changes my genome and kills me forced upon me. That crushes families with debt and murders patients who were told it was wrong and stupid to ‚Äúdo their own research‚Äù. Quit being lazy and do the work. The media is bought and is propaganda meant to brainwash you and based on how things went down they did their job splendidly. 

I watch it because everyone wants to pretend this is over, wants to pretend it never happened, wants to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù, we are 3 years into a 10 year war of a fight that has been raging for 10,000 years and most people haven‚Äôt a clue what I mean when I say that here.

‚ÄúLost it‚Äôs steam‚Äù‚Ä¶ I seriously hope you didn‚Äôt pressure anyone else to feel like you weren‚Äôt alone in your decision.

This has just begun and famine will come soon. Along with war to kill off excess males who have nothing to live for and have been going through conditioning telling them they‚Äôre weak and toxic for the past decade, now being told they‚Äôre not a real man unless they go die for some evil fuckers they‚Äôve never met on the other side of the planet.

Seriously. It‚Äôs time for humanity to grow up and evolve, take responsibility and end this once and for all.

No more cowards, no more traitors, no more secret societies and no more genocides.

YOU HAVE HOMEWORK TO DO.

Go on Rumble and Find Dr John Coleman‚Äôs speech roughly 25 years ago on the Committee of 300. Start wrapping your brain around what has been happening over generations and face the darkness within yourself that allowed us to get here. The shadow that prevents you from seeing that this evil is truly out there. Own it within yourself and make amends.

They have no authority except that which is given. Deny them that. Get back to basics and lose the tools of your oppressors or use them against them. 

You have to know who you‚Äôre fighting and what you‚Äôre working with if you have any hope of winning this war, and you‚Äôre in a war for the soul of mankind whether you like it or not.","I'm pleasantly surprised and pleased to see such a logical and not outright antivax reply. Kudos!

That being said, for OP, I think a lot of people forget that all medicine is poison and all poison is medicine. Everybody's genetics, environment, and overall health is different and as such everyone's body will react differently to the same treatment. Nearly every modern medicine has some percentage of recipients who experience extreme and rare side effects which can sometimes include disability or death. But more often than not nearly everyone who receives that same medicine will be perfectly fine. If you've gone several years without experiencing debilitating complications then I would go ahead and assume you're fine. 

I had the initial shot and two boosters, but I will no longer be getting more. I think the virus has lost steam. Unfortunately I caught covid before the vaccine was even available and have ever since suffered with long covid issues. I was also infected with covid twice more after getting the vaccine but both of those cases were extremely mild. Although we are calling it long covid it's not any different than the rare but not unheard of symptoms sometimes associated with viral infections. 

Bottom line, don't stress and just do your best to live a healthy life, because tomorrow is promised to no one. We're all in this together, sick or healthy, and nobody gets off this rock alive.

 There is a clear association between number of required doses in kids and the rise in learning disabilities, social disorders, autism, mental illness, and confused sexual identity. Autism cases were extremely rare before the 80's, but now it's extremely common to be on the spectrum. 

Instead of addressing the issues, big pharma invests in controlling the mainstream media, and social media influencers by promoting the idea of normalizing autism and sexual deviancy in the same way they normalize obesity.

In 2022 my obgyn doctor advised me not to take ANY mRNA vaccines and if I absolutely had to get a covid vaccine to get the Johnson and Johnson one. He said that there where studies starting to come out showing the mRNA was effecting the reproductive organs of men and women and he saw a huge increase after the release of the vaccines in menstrual cycle issues. He seemed very concerned with the long term effects of what was happening. Of course a lot of what he said I can‚Äôt remember the medical terminology he used but said his teenage daughters did not get it and he had to fight like hell to get exemptions for them.

803,Secure_Cry_5194,ConstProgrammer,2023-06-18 05:24:22,"Ok, let's be fair here. For sure, the vaccine is definitely not good for you. But that's not the only thing in modern society. There are lots of environmental factors just as bad, if not worse. For example, wireless 5G radiation, toxic pesticides, preservatives, artificial sweetners, artificial colors and dyes which are absolutely everywhere, hormone disruptors in the public water supply, asphalt dust that you breathe in, microplastics, glyphosate, leaking underground tanks in gas stations, the list goes on and on. While any one of these factors in isolation is harmful in it's own right, but the organism can recover from the damage, multiple factors converging together would surely end in the death or disability of the person sooner or later. The modern industrialized society is literally killing us. The human organism was not meant to survive in such a sea of toxins. Therefore it is imperative to minimize your exposure to any toxins going forward from here, if you want to maintain your and your children's health and survival in the dystopian world.

People around here are proud to have ""pure blood"" because they haven't gotten the vaccine. Oh yeah, but what about the other environmental toxins that you are affected by? They make your blood dirty too. The best way is to live a ""clean"" or ""green"" life, away from civilization, in the middle of the woods or something. To grow your own vegetables, drink clean well water, and not go to the doctor except if it's an emergency that you can't handle using Traditional Chinese Medicine. Live similar to the Amish, wait for a couple generations, until all the city folks start to die off from the sea of toxins that they are daily exposed to.

851,RandomJew567,Secure_Cry_5194,2023-06-18 03:56:43,So you're saying there have been people specifically studying the vaccine to find things wrong with it? I took the Phizer one; have you heard of anything found long term about that one?,"The vaccines have been out for years now. Billions of doses have been given, with tens of thousands of studies conducted, and in that time, scientific consensus has overwhelmingly concluded that the vaccine is safe with the handful of major side effects being both exceedingly rare and only observed in the first few weeks after vaccination.

There is no mechanism by which long term side effects could occur. There is no evidence suggesting it can cause fertility issues. And the idea that, years down the line, you'd have to worry about some unspecified harm is effectively just ignorant."
852,Secure_Cry_5194,RandomJew567,2023-06-18 04:53:50,"Tens of thousands of people across the globe have been involved in studying the various different vaccines across the globe. And even before its release, Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical companies conducted trials to determine its safety and efficacy - so yes, people do specifically study these things. 

From what these trials and studies have uncovered, common side effects from the vaccine include headache, fatigue, pain, chills, and other minor symptoms like that. In *extremely rare* cases, it's been found that the vaccine can additionally cause ailments like myocarditis, anaphylaxis, and blood clots. But again, the rates of these occurring are astronomically low - according to [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html#:%7E:text=Myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis%20after%20COVID,rest%20and%20felt%20better%20quickly.), for instance, anaphylaxis occurs in ~5/1,000,000 doses given, and the other ailments have similarly low rates as well.

And as far as long term side effects, for one, there isn't any mechanism by which they could actually occur, as I mentioned. All vaccine materials leave your body in a matter of weeks following the vaccination. To my knowledge, there has been no documented evidence showcasing the development of side effects from any of the Covid vaccines an extended period after they've been administered.

If you're looking for a more specific study to reinforce these ideas, there's quite a few linked on the CDC page I already linked, but [here's](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2110475) another aiming to determine side effects associated with the Pfizer vaccine. The vast majority of side effects observed were not determined to be statistically likely to have arisen from the vaccine, barring myocarditis.",So you're saying there have been people specifically studying the vaccine to find things wrong with it? I took the Phizer one; have you heard of anything found long term about that one?

A whole horde of scientists could be thinking one thing, and they would still be wrong. One single independent scientist could be more right than lots of laboratories, schools, and government commissions. Don't underestimate people with independent critical thinking and an open mind.",So you're saying there have been people specifically studying the vaccine to find things wrong with it?

1161,EmpEro517,OctoberSunflower17,2023-09-10 13:11:26,"Here I can post this without being banned (I compiled & posted all this during the pandemic - now I included an update):

FACT: This Covid vaccine is the 1st mRNA vaccines in history - it‚Äôs completely brand-new vaccine technology. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines turn your body into a spike protein-producing factory.

FACT: All other vaccines in history have used traditional means such as live virus or attenuated virus instead.

FACT: There‚Äôs NO long-term safety data because clinical trials for both Pfizer and Moderna end in 2023.

FACT: This Covid mRNA vaccine does NOT prevent infection nor stop transmission of the coronavirus.

FACT: It simply promises to prevent hospitalization and death, except for ‚Äúrare‚Äù breakthrough cases. Omicron has infected SOOO many vaccinated people that ‚Äúrare‚Äù is not an accurate description.

FACT: Survival rate of Covid is 99.97%. For people under 40, that number is way, way higher. So there‚Äôs no need to inject healthy children or teenagers with it!

FACT: Sweden, France, Iceland, and Nordic nations are against giving Moderna shot to young under age 30 due to myocarditis (heart inflammation) risk. Some have even banned it for that age group.

FACT: US hasn‚Äôt banned Moderna for young people under 30. Why? Maybe because NIH owns 1/2 of Moderna‚Äôs mRNA patent.

FACT: Children and teenagers have higher risk of suffering myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine than from Covid itself.

FACT: 18,000+ deaths due to Covid vaccines are recorded in VAERS. Harvard study estimates that VAERS underreports actual vaccine adverse effects by as much as 100x. 

So true mortality rate of Covid vaccines may be 1,800,000. By contrast, In 1976, when the Swine Flu vaccine caused 50 deaths, it was pulled from the US market.

FACT: If you get vaccinated with the 2nd experimental mRNA injection and die within 14 days, you will be considered an unvaccinated death per the CDC.

FACT: Pfizer & Moderna mRNA trials do NOT have any IRB or Independent Safety Board.

FACT: Pfizer and Moderna initially promised 2 shots would be enough. They were wrong. Now it‚Äôs booster shots every 6 months for life.

FACT: Vaccine makers promised that spike proteins would not migrate throughout your body, especially not your reproductive organs. Now research has confirmed that mRNA shots have affected menstrual cycles.

FACT: FDA took 108 days to review Pfizer mRNA vaccine data before issuing it EUA (Emergency Use Authorization)- But now it wants 75 YEARS to release this safety data to the public. 

UPDATE: Thankfully the judge refused and forced the FDA to release the data. Oddly enough, shortly thereafter, the US scuttled the peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, leading to this war. 

FACT: If you suffer any serious side effects of the mRNA vaccine, you CAN‚ÄôT sue the vaccine manufacturer. They have ZERO LIABILITY.

FACT: Even if 100% of the entire human population on earth is vaccinated for Covid, variants will still mutate and spread. Why? 

Because the coronavirus has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get Covid. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been hearing lately in the news that we need to resign ourselves to Covid being endemic.

FACT: Sub-Saharan African nations who have been taking IVERMECTIN as a preventative FOR YEARS have not suffered a Covid crisis - & that‚Äôs despite VERY LOW vaccination rates.

FACT: Ivermectin won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for treating HUMAN BEINGS in 3rd World countries for tropical diseases. It has been used for more than 20 years and is EXTREMELY SAFE. It‚Äôs off-patent and very cheap too. It‚Äôs sold over-the-counter without a prescription in many countries.

FACT: 140 research studies worldwide show ivermectin‚Äôs effectiveness in both preventing and treating Covid.

What I learned:

GOLD STANDARD SAFETY STUDY = 
Double-Blind Placebo-Based Long-Term Study

This is required for pharmaceutical drugs to get to the market.

IT'S NOT REQUIRED FOR VACCINES.

Why? Because Vaccines are not classified as drugs. They are classified as blood and biological products instead. 

Since 1986, the US government gave vaccine makers NO LIABILITY. 

That means you CANNOT sue vaccine companies for a bad product or serious side effects. 

After 1986, the childhood vaccine schedule as a result TRIPLED = 
TODAY: 72 VACCINES.

If someone says, ""I'm fine - I'm vaccinated,"" ask them if they got 72 shots.

If they say, ""No, of course not, that's crazy!,"" then tell them that they're NOT vaccinated. Because that's what children get nowadays before they turn 18. 

U.S. has highest 1st day born death rate for babies.

Why? Because the U.S. is one of few countries to give Hepatitis B Vaccine to babies at birth.

10,000 babies die of SIDS in US per year.

28 Vaccines are administered in 1st year of a child's life in the U.S.

Vaccine industry is 1 of 2 federally protected industries in U.S. because Supreme Court says vaccines are ""unavoidably unsafe.""

What's in vaccines? 
Formaldehyde (linked to cancer), Aluminum (Alzheimer‚Äôs risk factor), 
Mercury (memory loss & neurotoxin), Polysorbate 80 (linked to infertility), 
MSG (neurotoxin), and 
Human (aborted fetus) & Animal DNA ‚Äî 

All of this injected straight into the bloodstream (bypassing detox pathways of body) and goes directly to organs. 

Planned Parenthood is selling aborted fetuses, parts of which are used in vaccines.

300 Vaccines are currently in development. Big Pharma is now going after adults.

Brandy made this video before the pandemic. 

She used to sell Vioxx for Merck as a pharma rep but quit when she learned of its deadly side effects. So she knew what was coming down the pipeline. 

She founded Learn the Risk org to spread the word - putting up billboards in cities and educating the public on social media. She became active against California removing exemptions for children vaccinations.

On December 1, 2019, Brandy Vaughan made a Facebook post stating that she is NOT suicidal, accident-prone, or on any legal or illegal drugs. If anything should happen to her, it would be foul play. 

She had even made a video of a break-in of her home which you can see on YouTube. 

On December 8, 2020 (1 year later), her 10 year old son found her dead on the kitchen floor. ¬†She died at age 47 years old.

Brandy died 6 days after posting on Facebook that she was in fear for her life and not suicidal. 

2ND VIDEO:  
Brandy Vaughan at Take Back Your Health Conference 2016, May 3, 2017 (look up this video title on DuckDuckGo search engine instead of Google due to censorship)","I have the same worry as I had back around 2010-2016. With the rise of the whole ""anti-vaxx"" demonization in the media, calling them loony tunes for questioning if some component in a vaccine gave their child a form of autism or not. It was worrying that you couldn't even question it or be reprimanded by society.

It got worse around 2016 I believe whenever measles started showing up in various places, I think Japan was one of them as well. Then the Anti-vaxxers were REALLY targeted as dangerous to society. My concern again, was to question the narrative at all was to mean you'd be hated. 

It began to manifest in my mind that down the line, there might exist some organization that could mandate vaccines. Since every vaccine is safe and never to be questioned, otherwise you're crazy, the blind trust could become an overwhelming factor. Whoever ran such organization might at the time have the best intentions (big assumption) but all it takes down the line is one or a few rotten eggs to push something truly horrific.

It may be that the current cov vaccines aren't a big deal down the line by themselves but once the trust has been given over, how many will just continue the trend and submit to the next and the next?

1294,InfowarriorKat,OctoberSunflower17,2023-09-10 13:20:24,"Here I can post this without being banned (I compiled & posted all this during the pandemic - now I included an update):

FACT: This Covid vaccine is the 1st mRNA vaccines in history - it‚Äôs completely brand-new vaccine technology. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines turn your body into a spike protein-producing factory.

FACT: All other vaccines in history have used traditional means such as live virus or attenuated virus instead.

FACT: There‚Äôs NO long-term safety data because clinical trials for both Pfizer and Moderna end in 2023.

FACT: This Covid mRNA vaccine does NOT prevent infection nor stop transmission of the coronavirus.

FACT: It simply promises to prevent hospitalization and death, except for ‚Äúrare‚Äù breakthrough cases. Omicron has infected SOOO many vaccinated people that ‚Äúrare‚Äù is not an accurate description.

FACT: Survival rate of Covid is 99.97%. For people under 40, that number is way, way higher. So there‚Äôs no need to inject healthy children or teenagers with it!

FACT: Sweden, France, Iceland, and Nordic nations are against giving Moderna shot to young under age 30 due to myocarditis (heart inflammation) risk. Some have even banned it for that age group.

FACT: US hasn‚Äôt banned Moderna for young people under 30. Why? Maybe because NIH owns 1/2 of Moderna‚Äôs mRNA patent.

FACT: Children and teenagers have higher risk of suffering myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine than from Covid itself.

FACT: 18,000+ deaths due to Covid vaccines are recorded in VAERS. Harvard study estimates that VAERS underreports actual vaccine adverse effects by as much as 100x.

So true mortality rate of Covid vaccines may be 1,800,000. By contrast, In 1976, when the Swine Flu vaccine caused 50 deaths, it was pulled from the US market.

FACT: If you get vaccinated with the 2nd experimental mRNA injection and die within 14 days, you will be considered an unvaccinated death per the CDC.

FACT: Pfizer & Moderna mRNA trials do NOT have any IRB or Independent Safety Board.

FACT: Pfizer and Moderna initially promised 2 shots would be enough. They were wrong. Now it‚Äôs booster shots every 6 months for life.

FACT: Vaccine makers promised that spike proteins would not migrate throughout your body, especially not your reproductive organs. Now research has confirmed that mRNA shots have affected menstrual cycles.

FACT: FDA took 108 days to review Pfizer mRNA vaccine data before issuing it EUA (Emergency Use Authorization)- But now it wants 75 YEARS to release this safety data to the public.

UPDATE: Thankfully the judge refused and forced the FDA to release the data. Oddly enough, shortly thereafter, the US scuttled the peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, leading to this war.

FACT: If you suffer any serious side effects of the mRNA vaccine, you CAN‚ÄôT sue the vaccine manufacturer. They have ZERO LIABILITY.

FACT: Even if 100% of the entire human population on earth is vaccinated for Covid, variants will still mutate and spread. Why?

Because the coronavirus has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get Covid. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been hearing lately in the news that we need to resign ourselves to Covid being endemic.

FACT: Sub-Saharan African nations who have been taking IVERMECTIN as a preventative FOR YEARS have not suffered a Covid crisis - & that‚Äôs despite VERY LOW vaccination rates.

FACT: Ivermectin won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for treating HUMAN BEINGS in 3rd World countries for tropical diseases. 

It has been used for more than 20 years and is EXTREMELY SAFE. It‚Äôs off-patent and very cheap too. It‚Äôs sold over-the-counter without a prescription in many countries.

FACT: 140 research studies worldwide show ivermectin‚Äôs effectiveness in both preventing and treating Covid.

>**‚ÄùGradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.** A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.

A chess player can sense when the enemy is planning to attack, it's no different looking objectively at what happened in the real world with the vaccine rollout.  I also think they manipulated Trump to get him to help with operation warp speed.  In one of his interviews he was talking about a meeting he had with Fauci and he asked how long it would take to get a vaccine to market and Fauci told him the minimum time is 3 years, and even then there is no guarantee that you will get it approved.  Now if you're Trump your looking at that like a bad for business decision, it's like ""C'mon that's ridiculous we can't stay locked down that long, we need to get a vaccine faster."" Most lay people prior to the pandemic would probably not have questioned or thought that vaccines could be bad, I think that's how  Trump was looking at that, like an obstacle that he had to overcome to get over the regulatory red-tape yet still develop a vaccine that was safe.  The interesting thing though is that Operation Warp speed was all planned out long before it was ever a thought in the President's mind, a guy named Alax Azar who is the head of the HHS and former president of Eli Lilly was the real mastermind behind Operation Warp Speed, and he had that all planned out long before Covid-19 was even a thing.  He actually got Trump to sign an executive order for a pan influenza vaccine in Sept. 2019 that would allow the govt. to develop vaccines faster and roll them out to the public faster sidestepping a lot of the regulatory hurdles.  In fact there is proof that this type of vaccine was being sought after long before Trump was in the WH, and I do believe it is about gene manipulation, in fact there is an article by Kathleen Miller  which was scrubbed from the internet in 2012 about DARPA seeking a special vaccine that would Alter the DNA of the Troops.  Vaccines have also been suggested as an endpoint for global depopulation by members of the eugenic society of America which Bill Gates father was a member of and other members of the Club of Rome which is another NWO/eugenics organization who published a book called The Limits to Growth and the The Rockefellers foundation which was also involved in research for the CIA also mentioned vaccines as an endpoint for birthrate reduction.",The Vaccine is Key

Our bodies naturally heal themselves and that includes our dna so they have to keep doing something to keep it subdued.

I got a severe cold at the end of 2019 and was tested positive for COVID in February 2021 (refused the vax). Since then, my nose & lung was always clogged (especially my right side) and I got some kind of brain fog from that shit.  
For other reasons, I started a protocol 5 weeks ago, and these issues (amongst others) improved vastly...problems described above nearly gone, hope it will dissapear over time completely. You might try this also:  
**The NAC Protocol (Updated February, 2023)**

  
Morning  
1200mg NAC  
Oregano Oil (min. 40mg Carvacrol)  
Black Seed Oil (1 teaspoon / 5 ml)  
Night  
600mg NAC  
Oregano Oil (min. 40mg Carvacrol)  
Black Seed Oil (1 teaspoon)  
Continue daily for a minimum of two months and count out 3 weeks with no die off symptoms prior to moving to the next step.

  
**Maintenance Protocol**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Morning  
600mg NAC  
500mg Slo Niacin (nicotinic acid)  
100mg Pterostilbene  
250mg Pomegranate Extract (40% EA)  
Black Seed Oil (1 teaspoon)  
Night  
500mg Slo Niacin  
100mg Pterostilbene  
250mg Pomegranate Extract  
Black Seed Oil (1 teaspoon)  
After every 3 weeks on the maintenance protocol, take 1 week off. Continue to use black seed oil during the off cycle.  
**Also:**  
I add 1 drop of fennel oil to my toothpaste on the brush and I started using Xylimed nose spray (or XLEAR, but that is more expensive where I am) instead of the cortisone spray I used before. Avoid yeast and sugar, at least try to reduce.","LONG COVID üíÄ. Its real i have it for 2 years now...some get it from the vaccine others from the virus...

That being said, I don't think it was made maliciously. If you were intent on global domination and had a poison that makes people infertile and die, why would you let your most loyal subjects take it? This would leave only the most skeptical and rebellious of people to survive and reproduce. Also, if you need a big government bureaucracy and strong military to dominate the world, why would you mandate that everyone in the government and military take the shot?

Also, if it was a piece of some great plan, how come the elites weren't all on the same page with their messaging? Trump pushed Operation Warp Speed and touted how great the vaccine would be and how fast it was being made. While he was doing that Biden and Kamala and many other Democrats were throwing shade at the vaccine, saying people shouldn't trust it. And the deep state was doing everything in its power to remove Trump from office. If he was the vaccine's most faithful spokesman why try and impeach him and prosecute all of his cabinet? Then, once Democrats were in control, the vaccine was suddenly this amazing wonder drug to them. If it was part of a conspiracy they would've really shot themselves in the foot with all their mixed messaging.

Never attribute to malice that which can more easily be explained by incompetence. It was made too fast without enough testing, the medical industrial complex decided it was too big to fail and put their weight behind it regardless, and then opportunistic politicians played to the fears of the people and acted decisively in order to get more votes.

But the vax isn't as effective or safe but we already so deep into dept developing this vax so we are making people take it regardless cause we don't lose as a for profit company. 

So we fix the numbers and lie but before we do this we make sure the government makes sure we are not liable for any injuries or death. 

Now let's make a way for them to take the vax by force without forcing them. How we do this?

Want to travel? Vax needed.
Want to keep your job? Vax needed.(in some jobs they required the vax or it was termination.)

Just keep the lie going and the only capital loss is human life. Thats a win win for them. They lose nothing and make millions and who cares if a cattle die they'll reproduce and make more...

It tells your body there is nothing wrong with the covid spike and to leave it alone. He says if you look into it, you will see this is already known.

-The stage is now set, he says over 3 billion people now have adequate levels of igg4 and the final phase is close. He said those in the know call it ""the process"". It is to reduce the human population by 5 billion (3 billion from igg4 programming and 2 billion from the fall out of 3 billion deaths).

-He said late 2023 the new and final covid strain will be released. This strain will have over 90% fatality but only to those who have igg4 in their bodies. They will mount NO immune response to this deadly strain. Unvaxed like him will basically have a mild cold.

-He said 'the process' will do a full psychological warfare media blitz, claiming the vax has caused igg4 and anyone vaxed has a 90% chance of dying from this strain. They will claim all governments knew and misled their people. It will be designed to cause mass panic and turn all citizens against their governments.

Im just worried and want answers, we aren't anti vaxxers or else we wouldn't have gotten it lmao. Nor am i now an anti-vaxxer. 

 I was actually diagnosed with anxiety and have been noticing heart rate problems since the vaccine. I got two doses of Pfizer and am 23 years old, perfectly healthy prior condition. 

I actually got covid twice, the second time I got two different strains at once and it was after I got vaccinated. It was still torture. I had symptoms like long cough  for about 7 months, and now I still get an occasional cough that persists. 

However; my anxiety after the vaccine has (granted) over time, become physical and is affecting my stomach. My anxiety has ONLY every been mental, like in a stressful situation I would maybe feel anxious, but it turned to a physical pain. 

I never had a PCP till I started getting these symptoms and saw someone. My doctor prescribed me two different kinds of medication for anxiety, hydroxizine, and fluoextine. I never started fluoextine because I really don't want to. I am very good at separating thoughts from feelings, but it feels kinda out of my control, what would once be an anxious thought has turned into an overwhelming pain. 

Despite life changes that I feel I should be able to tackle, I have been so miserable but not? I feel almost bipolar- that's the only way I can describe it, but my mental health has 100% declined whether it's due to that or external factors, but like I said- this feels like a happy time in my life and I am happy but struggling to stay happy. 

Not only that but my PCP sent me to a heart specialist to go check out my heart rate, since it kept fluctuating while I was there. I personally have not finished all the heart tests that I'm supposed to do at the cardiologist, and I am getting bloodwork done as well, and seeing a therapist, so I guess I will have more of an answer then. 

But it is worrisome that such drastic changes in my body are happening so quickly and I have no other explanation? And i too have thought of the vaccine being a culprit. 

Just because we have questions does not make us anti-vaxxers. In-fact you SHOULD ask questions and never inject something into your blood blindly. This was indeed a rushed process and at the time I felt it was right but with the lack of studies, I think I somewhat regret my decision.","Says not being an antivaxer by any means.

 I was actually diagnosed with anxiety and have been noticing heart rate problems since the vaccine. I got two doses of Pfizer and am 23 years old, perfectly healthy prior condition. 

I actually got covid twice, the second time I got two different strains at once and it was after I got vaccinated. It was still torture. I had symptoms like long cough  for about 7 months, and now I still get an occasional cough that persists. 

However; my anxiety after the vaccine has (granted) over time, become physical and is affecting my stomach. My anxiety has ONLY every been mental, like in a stressful situation I would maybe feel anxious, but it turned to a physical pain. 

I never had a PCP till I started getting these symptoms and saw someone. My doctor prescribed me two different kinds of medication for anxiety, hydroxizine, and fluoextine. I never started fluoextine because I really don't want to. I am very good at separating thoughts from feelings, but it feels kinda out of my control, what would once be an anxious thought has turned into an overwhelming pain. 

Despite life changes that I feel I should be able to tackle, I have been so miserable but not? I feel almost bipolar- that's the only way I can describe it, but my mental health has 100% declined whether it's due to that or external factors, but like I said- this feels like a happy time in my life and I am happy but struggling to stay happy. 

Not only that but my PCP sent me to a heart specialist to go check out my heart rate, since it kept fluctuating while I was there. I personally have not finished all the heart tests that I'm supposed to do at the cardiologist, and I am getting bloodwork done as well, and seeing a therapist, so I guess I will have more of an answer then. 

But it is worrisome that such drastic changes in my body are happening so quickly and I have no other explanation? And i too have thought of the vaccine being a culprit. 

Just because we have questions does not make us anti-vaxxers. In-fact you SHOULD ask questions and never inject something into your blood blindly. This was indeed a rushed process and at the time I felt it was right but with the lack of studies, I think I somewhat regret my decision."

1)Long term health issues are suggested to be the result of the vaccine.
2)This suggestion is being based on just a 'gut feeling'.
3)This gut feeling being fed by the thought that if you don't have any other explanation it must be the vaccine then.
4)Using the term 'Injecting blindly' in relation to these vaccines low key invalidates all worldwide scientific medical research on this subject.
5)And again: a complete lack of any (scientific) source as to where your claims or suggestions are based on.

You don't even have children and you claim people are crazy for not vaccinating they're children? Let me ask you this. A new life brought into this world is not even a day old yet and the first medical procedure the medical community wants to do is place a virus into that pure vessel. Is that not crazy? Before medicine advanced into what it is now meaning to actually prevent and treat and cure not keep you sick for profit, there was more trust. Yes technology has advanced, sure. But wouldn't you rely more on an intuitive factor/instinct such as trust? We as people in America are sicker than ever. We are brainwashed, everywhere we go something is being advertised to us, telling us what we need to be doing, psychologically grooming us with ads, commercials. Divorce rates are at all time highs, epidemics of multiple plagues are contributing to death, poverty, lifelong mental illness. We stopped thinking for ourselves. The united states is a silent dictatorship. The school system is a joke, curriculums don't even make sense but us conspiracy theorists are criticized mocked and ridiculed for daring to take control of our own lives?
If you don't have sick people that's an entire economy of wealth with no employment. Use your own brain. Instincts. Intuition. Do your own surveys on people around you. How many people under the age of 40 are on at least one medication to enter they're daily life? I'm 36 years old, I do not get vaccinated I have no health issues, I eat healthy and I use my own God given rights to question and challenge everything around me.

Also had to get the covid jab among many others given that I work at a health facility. Other than feeling a bit run down like having the flu for 24-48 hours after having the two jabs I got, totally fine. Even got pregnant and had a baby after. I also obviously work with a ton of people who got the vaccine and everyone's fine, I only know one person who had a bad reaction and they were still willing to get it again if required (that actually surprised me, but they're fine now, no lasting effects). It's part of the gig, whether you like it or not, to get vaccinated against infectious diseases, among other precautions. So, I'd have a long think about whether that's the career for you knowing that this situation may arise for you again in your lifetime and you'll be among the first to be asked to get the vaccine if you want to keep working. I've had the MMR more times than I can count since I don't hold immunity for rubella for very long. It's what I signed up for and I knew that going in. Personally, as someone working in this field, it seems a bit silly to still be requiring the vaccine, other than maybe slightly shrinking the risk of serious illness if you happen to be someone who's immunocompromised, but for the most part it feels like a waste of resources now. Sometimes those rules are just tough to reverse once in place for a myriad of reasons.  
  
The vaccines did their job (well the second best option) which was to give us a bit of a temporary buffer against overloading the hospitals with serious covid cases. They also sped up the evolutionary process/trajectory the virus would have likely taken if we'd all been naturally infected. Viruses tend to go through the path of least resistance. Infections in the upper respiratory tract are less severe than those in the lower respiratory tract and we don't develop lasting immunity to them - probably because we don't really need to, that's why we get so many colds in our lifetime. It's also why a vaccine that prevented infection entirely was always a bit of a pipe dream. The vaccines made colonizing the lower respiratory tract problematic for the virus and that kind of evolutionary pressure likely made it more advantageous for the virus to stick to the upper respiratory tract where it was easier to pass on (think of having lots of viral particles in your nose, mouth and throat when you cough or sneeze rather than deeper in your lungs) and less susceptible to our immune responses. There it causes less severe disease but can infect more people (including those who have been vaccinated).","I wanna get some opinions on this.

Everyone I know who has taken it , meaning about 6-8 people. all are on anxiety medication now after taking the covid jab.... When you do your own research into what was in them, you find many disturbing things, but for starters, graphene oxide was the most abundant poison .. Also a variety of parasites and parasite eggs... So for starters, researching on how to remove the graphene from the body....And just as importin, starting a parasite cleanse to clear out the parasites... The over abundance of these parasites cause a verity of issues including headaches and brain fog.... The vaccine was the ""bug"" that then was ""shed"" or spread around the globe in the form of a modified parasite.... Parasite eggs spread very easily.....This explains why people were beating the covid with the horse deformer.... Good luck...",I regret getting covid 19 vaccine

2052,Atomidate,scootypuffjr73,2023-10-28 23:28:54,"Well said. I feel like this has been contrived in some way by hospital administration. I don't have to know pathophysiology, but if I do I can anticipate pt needs and what to ask for from a doctor before it escalates. If we're just task based we don't need to be compensated as much. 

Example: the way they've altered our charting over the years. Now it's a little green check mark you get after every task you complete. Every med pass, every wound care or lab draw. Nurses don't work in environments that foster the development of critical thinking anymore. New nurses don't have a chance.","I think the unfortunate truth of the matter is that most of nursing is only science-adjacent or maybe derivative of science. Nursing work is kinda mechanical in that way, it's important for me to know what things do but not why or how. Having gone from ER to MICU, now CVICU- I never needed to understand *how* things work to do most of my job. 

I worked MICU in northern NJ during the 1st 2 years of the pandemic. We had people dropping like flies every day at the start. We bought our own body suits to wear at work before we knew how the virus worked. I imagine I was one of the first ~200 people in my state to get a covid vaccine when it was offered to healthcare workers. My family and I couldn't wait. Got my latest booster a month ago. I'll get more too.

It has never been a requirement for me to read or synthesize a journal meta-analysis for the work I do. That's the job (hopefully lol) of our educators and unit practice council. Implementing best-practices based on Cochrane reviews is not something expected of me. I'm expected to adhere to the practices and policies of the entity that signs my checks. ""Adjuvant"" is not a word that appeared during my nursing education. 

While the ceiling of nursing education, practice, and knowledge is very high, the floor of it is very very low. The barrier to entry (pre-reqs, school, NCLEX) felt high when I was starting down this path... but feel much less severe in the rear view mirror."

Our infectious disease chief just took over Dr. Fauci's position. We took care of the sickest ones. In the middle of it we were discussing the vaccine and how amazing the development of it was, and one of the nurse practitioners listening in pitched in about how she wasn't going to take it because she didn't know what was in it. I told her to go back to school, because I knew what was in it and she had no business running her mouth about this stuff when she's supposed to be in charge of our patients well-being.

I agree nurses should be a good example and be engaged with the science of vaccines. Early 20th century the top causes of death were childhood diseases. Vaccines changed that.

But there is a component now of corporations making money over just being altruistic. I think the latest COViD vaccine rollout is a great example. My kid‚Äôs pediatrician is a primary care doc and says in order to get the vaccine they had to put up a minimum of $10,000 to get the vaccine in stock- he even runs a travel vaccine clinic on the side. But who had the COViD vaccine stock? CVS and the big pharmacy chains only. Not even Costco had it until very recently.

The other issue is all of the misconceptions and outright lies people still believe about vaccines. Every fall when I would give flu vaccines (many with chronic diseases that were at high risk) there were always some holdouts that believed some of these things- like you could get the flu from the vaccine (immune response yes, full blown flu- no!). Often it was not logic or scientific evidence that convinced people to change their minds- but one thing that did work- a letter to dear Abbey and the response debunking the misconceptions about the flu vaccine! I would print that article out and disseminate to any doubters!

Now the antivax crowds are so strong and of course political- that recent studies show places that voted Republican in the last elections have higher death rates than areas than have voted democratic!

This could be holding conversations out what you‚Äôre struggling with. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a heated debate. The end result could be that the other person doesn‚Äôt  like your views, and treats you poorly and vice versa.

There should be debate about the vaccine; it is a piece of scientific technology and the way that these things improve is by interrogating the data fully to draw the best conclusion possible. 

It's also important to note that scientific research and the public health policies that they inform do not always translate directly. For example, as this opinion article notes, public health officials said that the bivalent vaccine was leaps and bounds better than the original vaccine when in actuality, the data showed no appreciable improvement. 

A number of people have already pointed out the underwhelming to, at times, criminal lack of understanding of basic science and scientific research in nursing from school to practice. As a recent ABSN grad whose previous career was deeply involved in scientific research, I saw my classmates go through a fairly lackluster research course at a top rated US university, and they were no better served having sat through that course. I think it is also important to note that the general public and the scientific community speak two very different languages, and scientists don't do a great job of translating.

2265,c00lname123,harmonicoasis,2023-10-28 19:23:10,"Two reasons IMO

Pre-2020, the antivax movement was a fringe, radical byproduct of the anti-intellectual undercurrent in American culture based on flawed, debunked studies by Andrew Wakefield. On the right it was conspiracy theorists and anti-gov hardliners who thought the government was slipping population- or mind-control agents into vaccines and then bullying parents into giving them to their kids for safety purposes. On the left it was alternative medicine kooks who at best simply distrusted big pharma and and worst were making money selling snake oil: crystals and essential oils they claimed went beyond placebo effects and actually cured diseases, even cancers. The average person didn't have a stance and typically got vaccinated as children. Some people skipped their flu shot because they thought it ""gave them the flu"" or were simply needle-phobic but that was the extent of it. There were still antivax nurses but it was less that nurses were becoming antivaxxers and more that antivaxxers were becoming nurses to give legitimacy to and spread their movement.

Post-2020 The COVID pandemic threatened the US economy, which was Donald Trump's main selling point for his presidency, so he turned any and all COVID containment measures into a wedge political issue claiming Democrats were using COVID restrictions to intentionally hurt the economy so that he would look bad and lose the 2020 election. Anti-vax became wrapped up in your political beliefs and *everyone* suddenly had strong opinions. If you leaned left it was about listening to the experts and doing your duty as an American to wear masks and get vaccinated so that we could get rid of the pandemic and get the country moving on to the new normal. If you leaned right it was that the government had no right to tell you where you could go or what to put in your body, and public safety was secondary to personal freedom. At my hospital the COVID unit became known as the R(epublican)-ICU because the patient population was almost exclusively unvaccinated conservatives.

I can't say whether that would have been reversed had the vaccine come out during the Trump administration. I hope not, but I remember being concerned that the vaccine research and production was being rushed so that it *could* come out during the Trump administration.

Simply put, they have failed to isolate an extremely relevant variable.



With hundreds of millions of COVID infections in the US population and a six-fold increase in the incidence of GBS among the infected, comparing the rate of GBS in the current vaccinated population to the pre-COVID population is essentially useless.


There are actually *two* confounding variables unaccounted for - (1) That community rates of GBS in the unvaccinated population have increased post-COVID, and (2) That GBS rates post-infection have been demonstrated to be lower in recently-vaccinated patients.

The observed follow-up period in person-years for a given vaccination profile and post-vaccination period was stratified according to age group and sex. Each of the age-sex stratified person-years were multiplied by the corresponding age-sex stratified background rate. This resulted in the expected number of cases in each stratum, which were then summed to give the total number of expected cases during the observed follow-up period. 

So the comparison is made by looking at data after vaccination compared to data from *before COVID or COVID vaccines existed*. Based on this comparison, statistically-significant elevated rates of Myocarditis and Pericarditis were observed within the following year.

The reason each stage takes so long normally, is that it's a huge cost to companies to set up trials.  So, they wait until they've completed the previous stage's trials before they make an assessment on whether or not the vaccine is worth moving to the next trial stage.  So, for normal vaccines, it's not the norm to schedule the next stage immediately after the previous stage.

With the COVID vaccines, the government put a lot of money into helping vaccine-makers set up their vaccine production facilities.  You not only have to prove a vaccine is effective, you have to prove you can make it reliably.  Since money wasn't an object, as it normally is for most companies, they could run the trials and production validation/verification in parallel.  Something that a company that had to pay for it themselves wouldn't do.

The COVID vaccines ran through all the same tests as any other vaccine would run through, but they were able to run some things in parallel due to government funding.

2406,lIIIIllIIIlllIIllllI,YesWeHaveNoTomatoes,2024-02-20 04:45:41,"The mRNA vaccines are a special case. Not that they were rushed, but that there had been a TON of existing, startlingly relevant research already done that the public wasn't really aware of just because it wasn't very newsworthy. 

\- mRNA vaccines have been in use for years in biomedical research to deliver very specific molecules to mice and other experimental animals. They did skip a few steps in animal testing because they had already been done.

\- Research on vaccines for SARS-1 (original flavor from 2003) and MERS (a much more deadly but less contagious variant from 2009 that never came to the US) had been ongoing for more than a decade.

\- Research on multivalent flu vaccines using mRNA vaccine had also been in progress for a while, providing additional data on safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in general. Some had begun doing early pre-clinical studies in humans, and although they had very limited data they also didn't have any safety red flags. 

So researchers already had two of the big difficult parts of the problem solved; once the spike protein was identified (not a difficult problem) and stuck into an mRNA vaccine carrier, they could move right into testing.

Testing was expedited purely by money and the vast scale of the emergency. Normally they do 4 rounds of tests: basic safety in animals, basic safety in humans, efficacy in humans, and long-term efficacy/safety in humans. The reason these tend to take a decade normally is money and recruiting volunteer participants. But due to government support and people's justified fear of the pandemic, there was no shortage of volunteers or staff salaries to carry out enormous trials. So instead of doing a 2-year safety & efficacy trial on a few tens of thousands of people to find rare side effects and then spending a year analyzing the data, they instead did a much shorter S&E trial on a combined total of >150,000 people (for Pfizer + Moderna, I don't know numbers for the other vaxes) and did data analysis in a couple of months. 

People who think there might have been a conspiracy are enormously underestimating the scale of this endeavour and the number of people involved who gave up their nights and weekends and worked around the clock on nothing else for most of a year.","Genuine question.

Like any drug trial, a vaccine trial starts by you giving half your participants the actual drug candidate (your vaccine) and half a placebo (for vaccines this is either a cocktail of all the adjuvants and other ingredients beside the active ingredient, or - more usually these days - another existing, approved vaccine for something else (e.g. flu, MMR, tetanus...)). But normal drug trials involve people who already have the condition the drug is supposed to treat, so what do you do with vaccines where people start off healthy? You can't knowingly try to give them the disease because that would be *extremely* unethical, so you have to send your trial participants home and let them go about their daily lives and simply wait for them to be exposed naturally.

So let's say you start a trial for an HIV vaccine in the US. You enroll a whopping 100,000 people and give 50,000 your HIV vaccine candidate and 50,000 a Tdap shot or something. Then you wait. The incidence (rate of new cases) of HIV in the US is 11.5 cases per 100,000 people per year. This means that if your participants were a representative cross-section of the American population, even after a whole year, there would just be 5.75 expected cases in each group - not *nearly* enough to see how effective the vaccine is (if you have 10 in one group and 0 in the other, that could easily just be by chance alone). So not only do you have to recruit an insane number of people, but you have to wait for years and years and years to see an effect.

With COVID-19, you didn't have to wait for years. It was spreading through society so fast that even if you used just 1,000 people for your vaccine trial, you would still be able to see a clear effect *within a month or two* (the actual mRNA vaccine trials still involved about 44,000 and 30,000 people, respectively).

And we know how the immune system works. No matter the vaccine, if there are any side effects, they will show up within a few weeks at most. There is no mechanism by which they would suddenly pop up three years later or whatever.

[EDIT] Placebo clarification","Genuine question.

In a normal vaccine research program doesn‚Äôt the process take way longer to ensure safety and if their are any adverse reactions then the scrap that version and go back to the drawing board? 

In other words, these Covid vaccines were rushed compared to other vaccines and adverse reactions were ignored because they were deemed a low enough risk compared to the urgent nature of their necessity? 

Basically the common trope by anti vaxxers is ‚Äúis these vaccines were rushed and therefore they are untested and dangerous, plus with other vaccines if they cause the injuries we have seen with the Covid vax then they would never proceed‚Äù

Is their truth in that argument?

What does a normal vaccine program look like and how much tolerance do they have for injury? If any?"

2472,RevolutionaryTone276,Baud_Olofsson,2024-02-20 08:54:43,"Not this study, since it was looking at a few selected conditions.  
That's what things like VAERS and EudraVigilance are for. VAERS in particular is usually either misinterpreted or wilfully misrepresented by antivaxers as a database of vaccine side effects, but it's not: it is a database where anyone can report absolutely anything that happens to them or someone else within a few months of a vaccination, not a database of confirmed side effects. Actual epidemiologists then regularly trawl through these databases looking for clusters of symptoms and correlations with specific vaccines to try to find potential side effects.

And when I say that you can report anything, I really do mean **anything**. For example, here is my favorite, VAERS 367379-1, about a possible side effect of Sanofi-Pasteur's monovalent influenza vaccine:
  
> ## VAERS ID 367379-1
> Killed in a car accident while pulling out of the street where the clinic was located. Was turning left onto a divided highway when the driver's side door was hit by an oncoming vehicle. Died on impact.

T-boned by a car and killed: potential vaccine side effect in VAERS. And this is almost certainly a good faith report (since it is open to everyone, people can try to discredit vaccines by filing false reports). It's this open by design specifically so that you can catch absolutely *any and all* potential side effects, no matter how implausible they might seem.",Would this study have caught other side effects that weren‚Äôt initially tracked?

Russia is not much more than a mob of very dangerous drunk savages. Perestroika was a brief wake up, quickly squashed. Putin is on the ropes domestically, and that's dangerous.


China, on the other hand, is a patient dragon with a 500 year plan. The plan has been upended by greed, so now they are desperate. But Xi is still patient, and beginning the next phase of the plan.


The reference to money -- and the power it wields -- was specific to much of the actual US conspiracies that have gone down, name any and I'll show you how.


The biggest conspiracy now is the emasculation of the US. China and North Korea are the primary catalysts of the social media influences destroying cultural norms. They want us to think it's Russia, but Russia is not clever enough. Leftist factions in the US are following in lockstep, and controlling the narrative. China is the world's primary expert (by a significant margin) on cultural control through subtle messaging. They have deep influence in the rising trend of unionizing low-value jobs (like Starbucks). Every state in the US has at least one sophisticated Chinese operation, some, like New York, several. Part of the long-vision plan is the slow weakening of the US, from within.

So now they can introduce robot taxis overnight with no social unrest. All Teslas are basically robot taxis in waiting, they can all be recalled and instantly put to work. Similar to I, Robot, where the robots are sent into the field and then suddenly become something else with a quick software update.

3113,Ok_Sea_6214,None,2024-04-18 10:06:40,The vaccine was taken and when the new virus is released targets those without the spike protein that will cause death. This is much more likely.,"It might be worse than that actually. I suspect the vaccine is actually designed to sabotage our natural immunity in a very specific way, and the deaths we've seen until now, while numerous, really are just unavoidable side effects.

Now they can release a new virus which very specifically targets that opening in our defenses, like a Trojan horse that opened the gates while everyone was asleep. Anyone who did not take the death jab (like Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Biden...) will be perfectly safe from what is essentially a flu virus (maybe get the sniffles), but those who've had their defenses shut down will be sitting ducks.

And like that they can depopulate 5.5 billion people overnight, with zero risk of collateral damage. But I think before they begin, they'll first do a great reset of society, put as many people as possible out of a job and onto CBDC UBI social welfare. This way when they start dying the economic impact will be minimal because they are already not adding to society, so they won't be missed.

If anything every death then will be a bonus, because that's one less UBI payment the government has to make. Hell even if they pay them the money it'll just expire unused because only that person can use it, it's linked to their biometrics.
