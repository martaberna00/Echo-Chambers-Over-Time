There are concerns that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades immune responses due to unusually high numbers of mutations on the spike protein. Here we report a super-spreading event of Omicron infections amongst triple-vaccinated healthcare workers, infecting 21 of 33 attending a private gathering in the Faroe Islands.

Additional clarification from the PDF:

The Faroe Islands, a self-governing group of islands located between Iceland and Norway, have been relatively successful in containing the COVID-19 pandemic [7,8]. **On December 30, 2020, the first Faroese received the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty; BioNTech, Mainz, Germany), the only vaccine used in the Faroe Islands**, and since a high proportion of the population has been vaccinated. As of December 8, 74.6% of the population has been vaccinated two times, and 13.6% three times [9]. From March 2020 to September 2021, the Faroe Islands had registered only 1,001 cases of COVID-19 (1,867 per 100,000) and two deaths (3.73 per 100,000). However, after loosening restrictions and the introduction of the more contagious Delta variant, a large outbreak has plagued the islands, with more than 3.300 cases and 11 deaths registered during the last two and a half months [9].  **This paper reports a super-spreading event where 21 of 33 healthcare workers were infected with the Omicron variant after attending a social gathering in early December 2021, even though all infected participants had been vaccinated three times and had a recent negative test.**","Omicron outbreak at a private gathering in the Faroe Islands, infecting 21 of 33 triple-vaccinated healthcare workers"

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. Different people will have different amounts stored and should take different amounts of time to become deficient.

If I look at Figures 1 and 2b of [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118108) vitamin D appears to be higher in September/October than in May/June, like people have a summer's worth of vitamin D stored in early fall, but a winter's worth of depletion to overcome in the spring.

But that's just one study, with its own set of limitations and caveats... I wonder what else is out there on temporal trends in vitamin D status that would let us get a better look at whether or not vitamin D levels behave in a manner consistent with them being the cause for this correlation.","I almost spat out my coffee when I saw that the R^2 was .77.

To determine the factor triggering the sudden surge of daily new COVID-19 cases arising in most European countries during the autumn of 2020. The dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months of reported daily new cases in 18 European countries with latitude ranging from 39° to 62°. 

The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and the 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity but shows an impressive linear correlation with latitude. 

The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below ≈ 34% of that of 0° latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration variation into the reported link between acute respiratory tract infection risk and 25(OH)D concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics. Several studies have already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19 severity. 

However, by comparing different patient populations, discriminating whether a low 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor underlying COVID-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness that is the primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit of being triggered only by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. decreases in the sun UV daily dose.

225,None,Max_Thunder,2021-01-24 02:51:04,"South African's numbers have been declining sharply since around Jan 12 just like many countries in the north hemisphere while it cases were really low in the spring (our fall). However its first wave in 2020 was really late, in the middle of the southern hemisphere winter essentially.

I get the impression there are really specific epidemiological patterns observed depending on the part of the world and that the sharp decline we see in summer in North America and Europe for instance is not necessarily going to be seen in the southern hemisphere at the equivalent season. And that there isn't going to be any single factor (like vitamin D) that is going to explain it all.

I'd be curious if there wouldn't be other ways of looking at all this, like instead of looking at temperature or humidity, look at the delta in temperature or humidity for instance; e.g., increasing cases in the fall in the north hemisphere would be helped in part by the air becoming increasingly dryer and the impact of that on some of our innate immune defenses in the lining of the respiratory system, i.e. the issue would be that the air gets progressively dryer and our innate defenses never quite adapted to it, and not that the relative humidity is below a certain threshold. 

Or maybe there are unknown seasonal patterns to the immune system that could be based on the photoperiod (mediated by melatonin), but the key factor wouldn't be the photoperiod itself or the associated amount of melatonin, but whether melatonin is increasing every day or decreasing every day. Just some relatively wild hypotheses, although it is known that melatonin/the photoperiod can influence the immune system.",[deleted]

(Search r/Covid19 for the sources I refer to or look at my profile for previous postings with them in it
..

In December I read a paper which explained exactly what it is that Vitamin D does that is relevant to and beneficial against SARS-CoV-2.

In the body Vitamin D, via the Vitamin D receptor, stimulates transcription of cathelicidin which is cleaved to generate LL-37, a human antimicrobial peptide. One of LL-37's jobs is to defend against enveloped viruses. If you have low Vitamin D, you probably have low LL-37.

The team “demonstrated that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inhibits binding to its receptor hACE2, and most likely viral entry into the cell.” (5)

As LL-37 was a new term for me, I read up and found this paper from May 2020: Vitamin D Deficiency and Air Pollution Exacerbate COVID-19 Through Suppression of Antiviral Peptide LL37. (6)

Basically, when Vitamin D levels are good, then LL-37 does its job defending against enveloped viruses: it binds to the spike preventing it docking.

However, Vitamin D deficiency in combination with exposure to air pollution, inhibits LL-37. (Pollution causes the positive charge of LL-37 to change to neutral and as a result there is reduced or no binding.)

On top of this, air pollution (both outdoor and indoor) leads to increased oxidative stress and increased ACE2 expression.(7) This means more docking points for the virus if you’re exposed to it.

Since November there have been many papers from different countries showing correlations between levels of air pollution and incidence of COVID-19 cases & deaths (10) (11) (12) (13) (14).

Indoor pollution includes log burners, open fires, candles, incense, wax burners, gas cookers, gas fires. Basically, all forms of indoor burning are not beneficial.

The bad news:

-Most people have low or deficient levels of Vitamin D which means they have less LL-37 working against envelope viruses.

-Most people are exposed to high levels of pollution (outdoor and indoor).

It’s a perfect storm:

- variants which have an increased affinity to ACE2

- many people with increased ACE2 receptors caused by the air pollution (candles, log fires etc)

- reduced amounts of LL-37, which is also not working correctly (thanks to low Vitamin D and air pollution)

50% is pretty significant, especially on top of the protection they already have from the previous shots.  The third shot is almost certainly that point of diminishing returns, but it's certainly worth it for countries that have the supply and logistics to make it happen.

Here is what I have gathered about antibody levels and protection based on my review of the evidence, to no one in particular. Based on the ""best"" antibody data we have that I am aware of, which are generally Pfizer and Moderna's press releases of their ongoing clinical trial results, antibodies start out much lower against variants like Beta and Delta and reduce from there. But also note that a 3rd dose booster produces a much higher antibody level against the variants than even the original 2-dose regime did against the original disease manifestation.

(By ""best"" data, I mean ""the most representative dataset"". This is not necessarily the same as the most peer-reviewed and fully published COVID dataset available, which is what defines ""best"" to many others. But I think it is a mistake to over-privilege the most peer-reviewed datasets when their underlying data don't represent the Delta timeframe, or when the most peer-reviewed study that reports high efficacy against Delta was studied only on a relatively recently vaccinated population. This is the fault of many hot takes going around on the different efficacy data reported in different areas).

Moderna's antibody data tells a similar story: smaller protection to start with against the variants that wanes from there (Moderna does have a higher antibody starting point that delays waning some though), and 3rd dose boosters skyrocket those low antibody levels up to much higher than they ever were. Here's actual papers on that.

Now that we know generally where the antibody count is at for a certain timepoint for a certain variant, it is useful to compare to the best data I know of on ""how high of an antibody level do you need to produce a certain percentage of protection against symptomatic illness"". (Using only antibodies to predict protection in absence of T-cell or B-cell data provokes groans from some, since typically they contribute to protection too. But as it turns out for COVID-19 symptomatic illness, by far the largest predictive role goes purely to the antibody level. This is why papers like this one could track and even predict other vaccine's efficacy against symptomatic illness just by assessing the antibody levels alone).

I would not take the exact numbers as prescriptive, just the order of magnitudes and the general shape of the curve. But you can compare that graph to the press release antibody titer graph from the two companies. That lets you get an idea of how effective the waning antibody levels are vs the boosted levels (being careful not to confuse pseudovirus titers and live virus titers...generally different assays make it hard to compare different antibody papers directly, which is why that paper above normalized to the fraction of convalescent sera's protection).

So anyway, when I take all that antibody data and compare it to the various efficacy data coming out from Israel, it becomes clear to me that waning is most likely a real thing that is happening. In absence of looking at the antibody data like this, I see how others come to different conclusions from just looking at efficacy data--Nate Silver outlined the challenges that can make those datasets noisy and imperfectly predictive here...

...but with antibody data included, the most parsimonious story involves antibody waning to some degree. Even the higher starting protection from Moderna will drop off a cliff the same as Pfizer, maybe not too long afterward based on that curve above. 

So I wish we would pivot quicker to telling folks that, yes waning will happen in 6-8 months, which will impact much if not most of your protection against symptomatic illness from COVID-19. But you can get a 3rd dose booster to completely fix that issue if you choose to avoid sickness and any risk of Long Covid. And even if you don't want a 3rd dose, your severe disease protection will stay pretty solid with just 2 doses.","is there any data that ""natural"" immunity from infection also works this way? or just assume so? no reason to suspect antibody and t-cell behavior from an artificial trigger would behave differently from organic one?

So I wish we would pivot quicker to telling folks that, yes waning will happen in 6-8 months, which will impact much if not most of your protection against symptomatic illness from COVID-19. But you can get a 3rd dose booster to completely fix that issue if you choose to avoid sickness and any risk of Long Covid. And even if you don't want a 3rd dose, your severe disease protection will stay pretty solid with just 2 doses."

The immune response in response to natural infection is certainly different to the response to vaccination (for one thing, the former has a pretty significant chance of hospitalising or killing you). From the other side of things, the vaccines present very tightly controlled proteins (generally the most strongly conserved ones), whereas natural infection presents the whole gammut, so the body produces an immune response to those specific proteins in the former case, and to a largely-random scattering of proteins from across the virus in the latter.

Assuming this has some correlation with protection, then the breakthrough cases might be selectively moving through the weaker responding fraction of the population. This could mean that the waves happening now will create a larger-than-expected increase in population immunity (compared to similarly sized waves before we had vaccines).

Heterogeniety in suspectibiliy has always been a feature in COVID epidemic curves, and it generally helps the waves crest earlier because the people who are most likely to spread the virus tend to become immune early on. This time there could be an additional form of heterogeniety (vaccine response), so the effect might be even stronger, limiting the size of the first post-vaccination wave and causing a big decrease in cases on the far side.

Then there is this gem: 

>Of the 514, 59% were fully vaccinated. Of the vaccinated, 87% were 60   
or older. “There are so many breakthrough infections that they dominate   
and most of the hospitalized patients are actually vaccinated,”

I mean, yeah, you have a large majority of people vaccinated, it is not a real surprise that you are seeing this. 

What I dont like to see in such articles are opinions of singular people that concern singular locations. 

> “The staff is exhausted,” he says, and he has restarted a weekly support group for them “to avoid some kind of PTSD

This is opinion making. Give raw numbers, ideally not from a single institution, but from the region.  

>“even if you get two-thirds of those 60-plus \[boosted\], it’s just gonna   
give us another week, maybe 2 weeks until our hospitals are flooded.” He  
 says it’s also critical to vaccinate those who still haven’t received   
their first or second doses, and to return to the masking and social   
distancing Israel thought it had left behind—but has begun to reinstate.

Once again, where are the numbers to see? If i read this, I dont want to take to the internet and dig them up, give them to me, show me the numbers to support these claims. 

Because this really just reads like an ad to reinstate and/or prolong NPIs. It also is the perfect ammunition for anyone who doesnt want the vaccine, because they can (rightfully so) ask: ""So why should i take it then in the first place?"". 

Yes, the preprint they briefly touched on in this article was discussed on here already, I do have my doubts on some of the findings in that one too, but that doesnt cover most of what has been laid out here. 

Overall, I am critical of this ""We must eradicate it once and for all"" mindset. It leads us into a perpetual cycle of NPIs, vaccine hesitancy and hardening fronts, let alone that it is quite literally impossible. Just imagine trying to get all of Afghanistan to stay isolated for two or three weeks and that is just one of dozens of places where that will never fly.

The thing is that the vaccines that we have now induce antibody secretion into the blood. And the outermost layer of your nose/throat cells is some distance away from the bloodstream. There’s not so much antibody in your mucus to neutralise the virus that lands there. Also, it takes a few days for memory B cells in your [bone marrow](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4) to re-activate after you get infected. The peak of infectiousness and viral load is the day before or the day of symptoms. Once the B cells swarm to your nose/throat, they start to shut down viral replication, but there’s a bit of a delay.

This most likely refers to the serial interval rather than the incubation period. This is the time period between symptom onset or diagnosis of the index case with symptom onset/diagnosis of the secondary case.

Meaning if every sick person infects 6 people, shouldn't we have a lot more sick people? Here's the math I'm doing, and I may be misunderstanding how Rt works so if I am someone let me know:

on July 1, the 7 day average new cases was about 20,000. Today the 7 day new case average is about 140,000. Those numbers are 7 weeks apart. Assume the Rt is over a week, meaning 1 sick person infects 6 new people over the time span of a week. (Admittedly this may be the source of my confusion, because this is kinda a big assumption). So if every week, the number of new weekly cases increases by a factor of 6, then at the starting point you have 10,000, then the next week you have 6 times as many, so 60,000 new cases etc. So new cases is calculated as:

New cases(week x) = starting cases X growth rate^week

or 

New cases(week 7) = 10,000 X 6^7   (meaning an Rt is a 600% growth rate) 

Which gives a solution of 2.8 billion new cases, which is obviously wrong. So what am I missing? Am I misunderstanding what an Rt of 6 means?",I'd seen estimates as high as 9. This is an improvement on those...

No. 

Covid spreads through aerosols AND droplets. Masks (even just surgical masks without a seal) reduce droplets. Since more virus in the air means more likely to infect someone, the less the better. And since initial viral exposure (viral load) affects how serious your symptoms are, being exposed to less virus is good. That's why so many medical workers got so sick, they weren't just infected, they were infected by a dozen people at once. Hence they got sicker than usual.
