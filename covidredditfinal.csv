I don’t mean to downplay the severity of this outbreak at all, especially for those in the endemic regions.

It’s exciting, and our culture is addicted to entertainment of all kinds. A lot of people have asked about getting the Flu shot. While the flu shot covers *Influenza* virus, which is very different from this 2019-nCoV, a *Coronavirus* - you should know that influenza has killed several thousand people this season in the US alone already. If this outbreak is alarming to you, it should be a good reminder to get your flu shot if you haven’t yet!

EDIT: I of course can not speak on behalf of the Chinese government or Chinese medical officials. There is a metric ton of speculation being thrown around as fact at this point, and it’s too early still to have solid numbers for any meaningful statistical analysis. I would urge you all to be very careful where you get your information from. If it’s not from a website that ends in *.gov* or from the WHO or CDC directly - I would be wary. In the coming weeks try not to focus so much on the panic inducing click bait articles, and wait to hear from reputable organizations on official data. 

Note: The mortality rate can only be calculated based on those who are *confirmed* serological cases - there are undoubtedly many more cases who are not officially documented; who either don’t seek medical treatment or do but are not tested for 2019-nCoV and sent home. This is why the official reported mortality rate for these things is hard to assess, but logically is a gross overestimate of reality. Especially being so early in the course of this outbreak we don’t have any remotely reliable numbers. 

In the meantime - if you are in a region of exposure risk you can best protect yourself by avoiding crowded public spaces as much as possible. If traveling a simple surgical mask should suffice as these Coronaviruses are known to spread mainly via respiratory droplets in the air (cough, sneeze, normal breathing). Getting your hands on an N95 or better would offer more protection, but probably isn’t necessary outside of a medical facility. Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching your face with your hands. This doesn’t guarantee anything but can help prevent many infections. I cannot give out medical advice on here - if you or someone has any concerns for your health it is important that you see a health care professional in your area to be evaluated.

57,MrCommentyCommenter,Kastler,2020-01-25 04:25:25,"Glad to finally see another physician here. Exactly this. Media is blowing it up because China and other governments are likely not reporting/over run with new cases every minute. The main thing that needs to happen is education about what the virus does and when to get help. Media typically reports the information that gets views rather than saves lives or prevents spread. It’s pretty sad that when I google Coronavirus, it brings up an article with the title like “Patient dead by new coronavirus” when it was an 80 year old male with emphysema and other complications and they proceed to quote young patients who were told to go home and take some medication to prevent spread and get over the illness. They “believe the hospital is not handling this well.” Well maybe try to look up some info about the virus and try to minimize spread by staying home unless you need medical attention. I hope the WHO or CDC can send some actual recommendations to the population about what they can reasonably do to prevent spread and treat at home.

EDIT: found a decent graphic on signs and symptoms until a certain organization can make an actual recommendation.

EDIT 2: to be clear I don’t want to demean the severity or implications of this outbreak. We simply don’t have enough info so far. I’m really hoping someone can publish some real guidance soon. Yes the graphic isn’t for this outbreak but it is for people who don’t even know what Coronavirus is 👑 to understand what we may be dealing with until there is more formation

EDIT 3: since people did not like the graphic, here is at least a bit of info directly from the WHO. Hopefully more to follow.

In the coming weeks try not to focus so much on the panic inducing click bait articles, and wait to hear from reputable organizations on official data. 

Note: The mortality rate can only be calculated based on those who are *confirmed* serological cases - there are undoubtedly many more cases who are not officially documented; who either don’t seek medical treatment or do but are not tested for 2019-nCoV and sent home. This is why the official reported mortality rate for these things is hard to assess, but logically is a gross overestimate of reality. Especially being so early in the course of this outbreak we don’t have any remotely reliable numbers. 

In the meantime - if you are in a region of exposure risk you can best protect yourself by avoiding crowded public spaces as much as possible. If traveling a simple surgical mask should suffice as these Coronaviruses are known to spread mainly via respiratory droplets in the air (cough, sneeze, normal breathing). Getting your hands on an N95 or better would offer more protection, but probably isn’t necessary outside of a medical facility. Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching your face with your hands. This doesn’t guarantee anything but can help prevent many infections. I cannot give out medical advice on here - if you or someone has any concerns for your health it is important that you see a health care professional in your area to be evaluated.

It’s a coronavirus which there are tons of and some are worse then others. The huge response by China is a swing in the other way because during the SARS outbreak China under reported and was not upfront with information on the virus and the severity. Now it seems to be going the other way. A quarantine of this magnitude has never been done before. This coronavirus is still in the early stages and probably will be prevalent in all countries. The medical community has to see the severity of the virus and also it’s virulence.

Of 750\~ confirmed cases, 40 have died and 32 have recovered. Without swift medical intervention that we are seeing now, we have a baseline vision of what the future of this virus could look like if not contained and treated. Now that WHO and (hopefully) China are on top of it, this thing shouldn't be as big of a deal--but the potentiality of it cannot be understated. We are very lucky to have the globalized reaction we have today.

Unfortunately, many people don't want to go through the quarantine intensive health-care systems around the world, and would rather live in denial of their disease, leading to cases being under reported and these individuals not only at great risk themselves but great risks to others as well. In areas where healthcare is either too expensive, or too infrequent, this disease would be utterly devastating to a populace unable to seek intervention.","After experiencing so many viral outbreaks the CDC and local health organizations have gotten much better at responding to these situations.

Getting your hands on an N95 or better would offer more protection, but probably isn’t necessary outside of a medical facility. Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching your face with your hands. This doesn’t guarantee anything but can help prevent many infections.

We know for a fact that there are a large number of SARS-CoV-related viruses circulating in bats. Tons of them, most likely. We know that some of these viruses can readily infect human cells. We also know that the 2019-nCoV is extremely similar to these SARS-CoV-related bat viruses. Further, this virus is spreading in the same way that SARS-CoV did - from some sort of animal in a wet market, which almost certainly served as an intermediate between bats and humans (if it wasn't just bats directly).

I am a coronavirus researcher in a lab that works with SARS-CoV, among other coronaviruses (though I'm in the US, not China). I promise you that nobody in the (fairly small) coronavirus field thinks what you're suggesting is even a possibility, let along probable. Every single coronavirologist would have told you that coronaviruses were well poised for another epidemic if you asked them weeks, months, or even years ago.

People aren't mentioning it because conspiracy-like speculation with 0 evidence or understanding of the underlying conditions is ridiculous. Also, the fact that it's a BSL-4 lab is entirely irrelevant, as SARS-CoV is a BSL-3 pathogen, as is the portion you included about CCHF, which is caused by a bunyavirus, a group of viruses entirely unrelated to coronaviruses.",[removed]

On the contrary, this is far worse.

You're right that if you're already infected it's better to have coronavirus than ebola, but if youre *not yet infected* which includes everyone reading this, then I would rather the outbreak is ebola. If you're uninfected, coronavirus is much more likely to end up killing you than Ebola, because it can infect lots more people.

Ebola spreads only through physical contact and has a very high mortality rate so people know they are sick and get immobilized or die before they can infect many others.

A virus like this with a low percentage death rate and airborne spread with symptoms people think they can just ""deal with"" can result in hundreds of millions infected, which leads to millions dead even if one in a hundred will die from it.

In terms of killing lots of people, this is just the kind of disease to worry about.  Ebola is too deadly to spread into a pandemic.

2. Death rates aren't encouraging.
3. There's no affirmative evidence yet that a vaccine can be made. That's likely to come, but ""likely"" isn't what you want to hear in this situation.
4. The main outbreak occurred in a country where the government and civil order aren't exactly on the best of terms right now. In the worst-case scenario, expect the Chinese government to act about as intelligently as the Iranians did after the airliner shootdown because the leaders will instantly think, ""Is this the black swan event that takes out the government.""
5. The apparent proximity to live animal markets is worrisome. Basically a gigantic incubator. No bueno.
6. Ebola is a wildfire virus that scares the hell out of people even in hardened war zones. That sounds bad, but it at least has the virtue that people don't fuck around about going to the hospital, enacting quarantines and generally just doing the right thing.
7. This edition of coronavirus looks a lot like other illnesses that float around this time of year. It's going to spread more than expected because people are going to ignore symptoms. Also, lots of asymptomatic people -- decent potential for a few Typhoid Mary's.

Follow-on methods will focus on the detection of viral proteins or host immune response. General host immune response is easy to detect (there are already tests out there) but incredibly non-specific - if you’re just testing for immune activation, any viral condition that has similar symptoms would also yield a positive result (e.g. the flu). 

The next best approach would be a test for anti-coronavirus antibodies - this is easier because all you have to do is synthetically produce the coronavirus protein and put it in an ELISA plate, and you can contact it with a patient’s blood sample to see if they have antibodies against that protein. That’s called a serological test - more disease specific, but it doesn’t tell you if they currently have the disease or if they just had it once before. For an emergent condition like this, that’s probably less of a concern.

The ideal approach (from an immunoassay standpoint) is to detect the coronavirus protein itself in a patient sample, in which case you have to have antibodies you can use to grab on to it.

It would seem that a physician would have access to the best available medicine and medical support, is there some way patients were handled differently once the virus was understood that caused mortality rates to be under 100%?","To answer some of your questions, the virus (and many closely related viruses) could readily be found circulating in bats, so that's how we know it came from there initially. As for the palm civets (along with raccoon dogs), the animals at the wet market that the SARS outbreak began at were tested for the virus, along with having an idea of who was handling what.

In terms of your patient zero questions, we know that SARS spread through a patient zero of sorts, though not quite in the sense you're thinking - several people were likely infected by the same animals, since they were being handled at a market. 

A doctor that treated patients of the original outbreak in Guangdong, China ended up traveling to Hong Kong and staying at a large international hotel. He went despite feeling sick, and ended up infecting several others, including family members and hotel guests who ended up bringing the virus back to their home countries  (Canada, Vietnam, etc.) or spreading it around Hong Kong, creating an international crisis that could all be tied back to a specific hotel/patient. The man died from the infection, along with several of the other guests he infected (including the WHO physician who first realized that a new, deadly disease was spreading and sounded the alarms)."

How do scientists backtrack the path the virus has taken in order to narrow it down to a specific animal? That seems crazy to me.

The more proteins two taxa (taxonomical groups) have in common, the more likely it is for viral transmission to occur between them. Because of this, groups whose lineages diverged more recently are more likely to share viruses. There are other factors that make transmission less likely as well, like ideal host body temperature. For example, opossums often have a body temp too low to sustain the rabies virus.

Because of all of this, any virus that binds to a receptor protein that evolved a long time ago, before different lineages diverged, will be able to affect a wide range of taxa. West Nile Virus is an example of one that is present in reptiles, mammals, and birds.

The assumed incubation period lasting up to 14 days is a estimated based on what we know about a similar coronavirus. It is not a measured period, but rather a conservative guess based on what we think is normal for another coronavirus. 


Second, being contagious is not a binary condition. For most illnesses ones degree of contagiousness changes over the life of the illnesses. We know that coronaviruses are spread mainly via droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes. By definition someone who is asymptomatic isn't coughing or sneezing. So while they may technically be contagious, they are probably far less likely to infect others than a symptomatic individual.","Can a scientist/expert in this field answer my question: since the Chinese government released the genomic sequence of 2019 nCoV, we have learned that the 2019 nCov shares >70% sequence similarity with SARS. I kind of interpreted this piece of information as the two are closely related strains(I’m a chemist with some structural biology background). But the much longer incubation period seems odd and the scariest part of this new virus to me. 

So my questions: 

1. Is the incubation period (up to 14 days) abnormally long compared to other known strains of Coronavirus? 

2. Does what we know now about the sequence and structure of  2019 nCov explain the much longer incubation period compared to SARS? Do we have enough structural/functional insight to understand why the new virus exhibit such long incubation period?

Very scary that asymptomatic patients are still contagious, and given the long period of incubation, statistical models are not looking good 🙁"

If the mutation makes the spread or reproduction of the virus more difficult (subject to its environment or even just circumstances), then that version of the virus will die out and have little impact on the outbreak. 

However, if the mutation makes the virus spread more easily, or if the environment of this infection makes it more likely to spread, then we’d find that more infected people will have this new mutated version of the virus.

802,None,None,2020-01-26 13:03:55,"Viruses aren’t really living things like human cells or even bacteria are. They are simple machines that float around randomly. When they bump into a living cell, it basically sets off a biochemical chain of events within the virus that causes it to change shapes and all kinds of other crazy things. Remember, viruses developed over billions of years, so don’t confuse their complexity with intention. They inject their DNA/RNA into a cell, which amounts to hacking the cell’s own protein machines, and makes those machines make copies of the virus! Then the cell eventually gets so full of identical copies of the virus that it bursts open and releases all those copies into the air or body fluid, and those new viruses float around until they too bump into a cell to repeat the process. All of this is random and by chance. Viruses don’t go out hunting for cells. They randomly bump into them and then a chain reaction occurs. A virus can be so effective at its job that it wipes out your immune system faster than your immune system can kill it. In that situation, your immune system will either self destruct in a last ditch attempt to kill off the virus (which will kill you) or the virus will wipe out your immune system completely and you will get infected by some other pathogen (bacteria) that ends up killing you. The goal of the virus is never to kill you. The virus doesn’t contemplate. It’s a machine that does one job and one job only- makes copies of itself. The viruses that do us the most harm and the ones that make copies of themselves too quickly for our immune system to handle. This coronavirus, for example, wipes out the immune system and leaves you vulnerable to pneumonia. It also causes that self destruct response which causes multiple organ failure.",Why do viruses end up killing their hosts sometimes?

823,TenYearsTenDays,simplequark,2020-01-27 20:56:51,"I can't answer the question about precedents, but I have some ideas regarding the rest of the question:

One thing we can pretty much rule out is that there is any kind of evil master plan behind this, nor is it an attempt to re-write history. The WHO [did classify the risk as ""high"" in their press conference last Thursday](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/the-latest-who-says-too-early-to-declare-novel-coronavirus-global-emergency/ar-BBZgD9G):

> ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" Tedros said, adding that WHO's risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally.

So why did it say something else in the report? My guess is that this is either a peek into the discussions that might have gone on behind the scenes, and that the WHO toyed with the idea of classifying it as a moderate risk before opting for high risk – or it was just someone making a mistake when adapting a pre-made standard text to match the specifics of this particular incident.

Lastly, that it happened three days in a row is most likely due to the way modern word processors work: My guess is that the reports aren't typed up freshly each day but rather updated and saved under a different name. Since the official assessment hadn't changed since Thursday, it's possible that no-one bothered to double check the sections that required no changes.

Is that an excuse for any of this? Nope – these kinds of errors shouldn't happen, and the WHO should definitely improve its error checking and proofreading pipelines. If they release a report, they should be sure that it says exactly what they mean it to say. This is important stuff!

However, neither is it evidence of any nefarious machinations. If this were a conspiracy, it'd be the most incompetent conspiracy ever: First state one thing, then release another, then add a footnote alerting everyone of a discrepancy. I can't figure out a scenario in which it would make sense to do that on purpose.","Has the WHO or any comperable body ever made an error of this magnitude before:

>WHO’s assessment of the risk of this event has not changed since the last risk assessment conducted on 22 January: very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.

824,simplequark,TenYearsTenDays,2020-01-27 22:55:55,"Good post! But I have to say it seems absolutely crazy for them to not employ a copyeditor / proof reader for a document of this significance. Hell, many research teams who are simply hoping to get their papers published do that and when it comes to the WHO with a situation that is this sensitive, it's really unforgivably sloppy to not do that. I'd be truly gobsmacked if they don't, and if they do, truly astounded that their go-to is wildly incompetent. 

So the very best case scenario is that they're really sloppy with this, when teams working on much less sensitive material will usually (though not always) go the extra mile to ensure that their output says what it should say. 

I have to say I don't fully buy it, but it is certainly the simplest explanation.","I can't answer the question about precedents, but I have some ideas regarding the rest of the question:

**Longer answer:**

There are several flaws in these arguments:

> The flu kills more people.

[The CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) that the in the 2018–19 flu season roughly 35.5 million persons in the US developed flu symptoms, and that about 34,000 of these patients died. That's breaks down to about 1 death per 1,000 patients.

For 2019-nCoV, there have so far been 4473 confirmed cases and 107 confirmed deaths. That breaks down to 23 deaths per 1,000 patients – in other words, much more aggressive than the common flu.

> The mortality rate of this virus is 2-3%

If enough people get it, 2 or 3% is quite a lot. In the above example, if those 35.5 million people had had 2019-nCoV, a mortality rate of 23 per 1000 (= 2.3%) would mean about 800,000 deaths instead of 34,000.

> and barely anyone has it.

So far, the reported case numbers have been increasing at a factor of about 1.39 per day. In other words: Within two days, the number of cases more than doubles. Should the spread continue at this rate, today's 4,400 cases would be more than 100,000 within 10 days and more than 1,000,000 within three weeks, etc.

> If you're immune system is strong there is really very little to worry about.

That is likely true for now. However, every transmission increases the risk of a mutation that might make the virus more lethal. That's what happened in the case of the Spanish Flu – the first wave mainly killed the old and sick, but the second wave also affected young and otherwise healthy people. This is not something that *has* to happen, and the specific circumstances of WW1 probably aided this development in the Spanish Flu, but it's still something that is possible and should be factored into any preventive effort.

To be clear, this is all just just back-of-the-envelope maths and shouldn't be treated as an accurate prediction. Mortality rates are usually over-estimated in the early stages of an outbreak, because patients with severe and life-threatening symptoms are much more visible than those showing little or no symptoms. Thus, actual recovery rates may be much higher than the current estimates. Also, we don't know how accurate the numbers coming out of China are. On the one hand, reality could be worse, on the other hand, the increased case numbers might partially be an artifact of a larger number of people being tested for the virus. Similarly, man-made and natural barriers (borders, oceans, deserts, quarantines, improved hygiene, etc.) will likely do their part in preventing the type of exponential growth outlined above.

Still, these numbers might give you an idea of why it absolutely makes sense to take this outbreak seriously. It's not going to wipe out mankind, and the risk for any given individual is comparatively low, but there is a risk that it might have the potential to do some serious overall damage. 

I'd say that there is no reason for individual panic, but every reason for authorities to try and limit the spread of the virus as much as possible.","I never understood why people worry about this while smoking, taking drugs, driving to work and eating fatty foods.

When your government tells you they are prepared, it is simply just a lie.. You can't be prepared for something that you don't know

The statement would be valid if you know what you're dealing with.. But we don't have enough information at this point of time 

To your numbers... The 23 per 1000 is not an accurate number. A person does not die the second they are confirmed to carry the virus.

If you take an average time of 4 days between confirmation and lethality, you'd come to a number of 100 per 1000, which is even more severe.. 

The longer it takes to kill the host, the harder it is to estimate the current strains lethality

Additionally.. The official numbers for ""recovered people"" don't add up..

The reason this virus is getting so much attention is how rapidly it murders your immune system and how fast it jumps to the severe response that leads to multiple organ failure and death.

It is also true that at the time, concerns were voiced in the scientific community about a 2004 incident of a pathogen escaping another Chinese lab, and about the Chinese workplace culture being at odds with the needs of transparency and openness in preventing lab outbreaks ([source](https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487)).

The fact that there was a large, poorly-regulated, unhygienic, wild-animal meat market in the center of the city provides a very plausible source for the outbreak.

Therefore there is really no basis nor need at this stage to give any weight to the theory that the virus broke out of the lab.

Edit: I’ll also add that reports indicate that several of the early patients had been in close contact with the market in question, which makes it an even more plausible source.","Is the assertion that one of China’s few level 4 bio labs recently locating within 8 miles of Wuhan and then the subsequent rapid quarantine of the city by government officials anything legitimate, or conspiracy theory tripe?"

>“In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for Disease Control’s Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Monday morning press briefing.

The CDC has the same answer somewhere in the coronavirus information pages, but i can't look for it right now.

You're fine.

Edit.

1420,FatSpidy,pippagrrrl,2020-02-21 07:02:41,"The virus enters a human body and immediately seeks out specific cells with complimentary receptor sites.  In this particular case, cells found in the human nose, throat, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are attractive targets. Once located, the virus binds to the receptor site effectively connecting itself to the host cell. At that point, a number of processes begin that allow the virus to fuse itself to the host cell membrane, breach it, and inject its RNA into the host cell thus infecting the cell.

Once the virus has infected the cell, it has found a nice cozy place to begin building copies of itself. Once the new virus has been constructed, it forces its way out of the cell, often causing the death of the host cell. The new viruses go in search of more host cells cells to invade and destroy, exponentially increasing the viral load until the body of the infected discovers the intrusion and launches an immune response. 

Obviously, there is much more involved, but that is the basic process. By entering the host cell, the virus is afforded certain protections. At least until the immune system gets riled up.

Insofar as the image you referenced, I wouldn’t put too much stock in it. We simply do not know enough about this particular virus to claim any certainty regarding how the virus will react to changing environmental conditions. Yes, if you raise the temperature high enough, the virus will be destroyed; however, the point where that destruction is guaranteed is far beyond  anything encountered in the human body or the environment at large. 

With that said, both 2-propanol and ethanol alcohols are Highly effective tools to reduce viral viability when use properly at the right strength. 90-95% would be optimal, but anything over 75% is acceptable.","So I very recently came across this [image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ2dAojPcCriOKqyWj_dJ2hKPiF2LFzNuSfgehAN-b3KoF9aUHB) for about the 10th time and a couple weeks ago a local news statement with the same info, albeit they just said ""high temperatures.""

1439,taatzone,None,2020-03-06 03:19:29,"Not odd, it's how almost all viruses are. They infect cells by binding to very specific receptors on the cell surface. Usually these receptors are different in different species. We've termed it viral tropism, and it's also why viruses can only infect specific types of cells - for example hepatitis will always infect cells in the liver and not immune or airway epithelial cells, flu will always infect airway epithelial cells and never liver or immune cells, and HIV will always infect immune cells and never airway epithelial cells or liver cells. The concern with cases like this outbreak is that viruses are constantly mutating and a ""lucky"" mutation can make it so that just one or a few viruses gain the ability to recognize the human receptor, and then the mutant starts replicating and spreading through humans. And then you have natural selection kicking in, so the virus that is now infecting humans rapidly acquires new mutations that make it even better at infecting and spreading between people.","When they say, that it only targets humans, isn’t it odd.

1546,afairernametisnot,None,2020-03-19 19:50:22,"A couple possible reasons for this discrepency come to mind:

First, let's be super clear that CNN is simply reporting the data put out by China's National Health Commission, not doing any independent investigations. We don't know how reliable that data is particularly with China's recent increasing hostility toward journalists, although *if* it is accurate, it certainly shows a remarkable success of their mass quarantine experiment. 

As for the US numbers, the 18 month figure is coming from the white house administration, which has proven possibly even more untrustworthy during this outbreak. They, however, do not state that they believe the crisis *will* last this long, but rather that they are making preparations *in case* it does. However, I do believe this timeline roughly tracks with how long many scientists believe it will take for a vaccine to be developed, so that may be the logic.

The truth is, there is a lot that even the experts do not know, that is critical for accurate predictions. Thus any predictions are based on assumptions that could be proven in hindsight to be wildly inaccurate. Stuff like how the virus will react as summer approaches, how effective various degrees of social distancing and lock-downs will be, and the degree and duration of immunity a person retains after recovery from COVID-19, etc, are all unknown (though some preliminary data exists for some of these, it is by no means conclusive). The answers to these things will drastically affect everything from the slope of 'the curve', to how many 'waves' of the virus we experience, and, of course, how long the virus lasts (assuming it is even possible to truly eradicate it)","Why is CNN reporting that three months after the outbreak, China has no new infections, but in the US we should expect 12-18 months of this?

Basically this is somewhat similar to the concept of vaccination, except the virus would be active and contagious. Also has a concept of competitive inhibition. 

I imagine there'd be a risk of the new milder virus mutating and being worse than the original one.

First, it takes time for them to be cleared from the blood and second, the cells that make the antibodies can continue to pump them out at a low rate over your lifetime. The levels can vary depending on the virus. For example, we can still detect antibody levels from childhood vaccinations in adults. But some adults lose them and need a booster. I'd pretty confidently say that after 3-6 months you can still detect COVID-19 antibodies.","Question:

Or think of it this way - you've got condition A that'll kill around 50% of those it infects, but due to how it's transmitted it's never going to infect millions - the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, for example, is the largest ebola outbreak in history but still only infected around 28,000 people, with 11,000 deaths.

Then you've got condition B. Now it currently will only kill around 3% of those it infects, but as it has the potential to infect millions it could lead to much higher death toll than condition A if it's let get out of hand.

1668,None,JAKSTAT,2020-01-31 02:09:07,"I am a PhD candidate in immunology, who is very quite familiar with the early stages of vaccine development and research. Here's what the process looks like:

- Figure out which part of the virus to use in a vaccine (1 day to 1 week). Design your vaccine.

- Make whichever part of the virus you have chosen to use. (2 days to 14 days)

- Test in animal models for effectiveness (minimum 14 days, as this is how long it typically takes for an animal to generate antibodies following one dose of a vaccine). This step likely will be longer than 14 days, and will need to be repeated a few times, to make sure the response you get is reproducible, and to study the immune response in more detail. How good are the antibodies? Does it protect the animal from infection? Might have to first set up a model of infection.

Right now we are at one month minimum. Let's assume we hit gold and get to move on to clinical studies.

- phase 1: test for safety, to make sure that your vaccine formulation does not cause adverse effects. Must apply for approval and recruit volunteers. Are you seeing the same response that you saw in animals? Still getting a good immune response to the vaccine? Minimum 3 weeks. 

- phase 2: test on larger group of people, for efficacy. Continue to monitor for safety. Takes at least 3 weeks to determine if effective. 

- if effective, scale up production. No idea how long this takes, as it is outside my realm of knowledge. 

We are at 2.5 months at this point, if everything goes perfectly, which is rarely does. Some groups are estimating 4 months or summer, which honestly is pretty amazing .","why does it take so long to develop a vaccine?

1700,None,None,2020-01-25 21:21:18,"No, this patent was for genetic sequencing of SARS.

From an earlier reply I posted:

from Factcheck.org:

""One patent is for a genetic sequence of the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, sickening more than 8,000 people and killing 774.

“The sequencing was done at the CDC during the SARS outbreak and they were the ones that filed the patent,” Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, explained in an email.

The CDC told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership to ensure access, and to prevent others from controlling the technology. In a phone interview, Columbia law professor Harold Edgar told us that following a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 2013, U.S. patent law no longer allows for patents on viral sequences as they exist in nature.""

I think this essentially means the CDC patented the sequence out of concern other entities might do the same and then hinder access to the sequencing, and after all this happened it was decided that virus sequences were not in fact patentable under law.",[removed]

Antibiotics does not affect **in any way** the viruses. It will not affect it spread, nor the likelihood of emergence of a resistant and stronger strain.
But in the other hand, misuse of antibiotics on virus will not affect the virus as I said but will affect the other bacteria that might have infected the person, and then rising the likelihood of strengthen of this bacteria.",[deleted]

Norovirus is a very common virus that has been around for many years. It causes vomiting and diarrhea and is frequently a problem in cruise ships and other concentrations of people. It is not related to the coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. There has been some diarrhea reported but most symptoms  for the 2019-nCoV are respiratory. 

>symptoms: pneumonia (41, 100%), fever (40, 98%), cough (32, 76%), and fatigue (18, 44%). Over half of patients also experienced shortness of breath (22, 55%), but headache (3, 8%) and diarrhea (1, 3%) were uncommon.  http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/studies-highlight-ncov-similarity-sars-family-transmission
