In the UK we have some urban estates like this mostly in rougher parts of Manchester. One council was famously selling houses for ¬£1, but the places had been gutted including stuff like hot water and plumbing pipes, light switches, basically anything resellable.

Meanwhile the average price of a house in the town my lad goes to school in is over ¬£600,000 ($700,000).

It's about non-tariff barriers to trade. The Single Market has a common set of regulations (plus directives that set minimum standards, mechanisms for enforcement etc.) that members share, so there's no need to check for regulatory compliance internally (but all the more to check it at external borders). There's *a lot* of bureaucracy and cost around proving that a good does in fact comply with regulations, or even a certifications process by a qualified authority for some. The last bit is indeed required for members' companies as well, but when you're outside, you essentially get to go through the certification process twice -- once at home, and once in the EU.  
There's also some extra work related to actually getting the preferential (i.e., zero) tariffs (Rules of Origin), despite the trade agreement, that wouldn't be needed for internal trade, either. It's not unusual that SMEs get around the paperwork (and legal risk) by simply paying the tariff instead.","That EU red tape would still affect the UK if they want to sell their good to the mainland... *but now without any of the benefits of actually being in the union!*

Are we talking about the economy, immigration, presence on the world stage?  I guess so, even though these aren't things being in the EU would have a meaningful impact on - the British economy has been shit due to years of conservative government, there IS no immigration problem (unless you're racist), and Britain's diminished standing on the world stage is due to the fact that the Commonwealth countries see themselves as countries first and territories second (which they essentially are).

1006,sparkymcgeezer,mvw2,2021-09-28 12:49:39,"Off topic, but the biggest problem with the healthcare act was heavy Republican opposition.  Republicans fought tooth and nail to oppose it.  When they couldn't stop it, they fought tooth and nail to damage and dismantle major components and targets of the healthcare act, crippling it and making it half of what it was supposed to be.  Republicans even fought against the roll out and hindered the release, hindered the enrollments.  Republicans were vocal about all the bad stuff about the cares act...the exact stuff they were causing.  Then for 12 years, they fought to remove it over, and over, and over, and over.  The healthcare act is only what it is because of HEAVY Republican interference and damage to it.  The healthcare reform that came was merely what was left after and in spite of MASSIVE Republican sabotage.  I was amazed we got anything at all, and it's still moderately better than what we had.  Just think how good it could have been without the literal war against it and if it could have been what it was originally envisioned.  It would be so much better. It LOST many major elements it was supposed to have specifically because of Republican interference.  Thank Republicans for the half-formed abomination we got, because it's what they created from their poisoning the entire way through.

I have never been more disappointed in a government and a single political party than what Republicans have been for the last 20 years.  They promoted a war (there were literally 3 months solid of pro war spam on TV to quell the anti-war, just like a second Vietnam sentiment before lying about WMDs and going anyways).  Then their act halved the value of the dollar (we never have recovered from this) and killed more than a million people, including many thousands of civilians.  Then they profiteered through it all and some made millions from the war.  Republicans actually started the healthcare reform, but then switched and adamantly opposed it when a Democrat was pushing it.  They poisoned the hell out of it and gave us half of what it should have been.  I'm sure there were a lot of lobbying kick backs to boot.  When Republicans had full government control, they did one single act during the time they could have done anything and everything for the public.  They created and passed tax reform that gave billions of tax cuts to businesses and the wealthy.  That was the one act they did when they had full reign of the government, nothing else.  They implemented tariffs (taxes) for billions of dollars upon the US public and cost of goods went up.  They bungled Covid which lead to over 600,000 deaths.  Now from that failure, there's lost businesses and supply chain issues that cost Americans businesses and raised the cost of goods considerably.  How bad had this been?  The products my company makes had to go up in price 20% in total to cover tariff costs and Covid supply chain problems.  Both are incompetence of government.  And they lied to the public about it, over and over and over and over and has not taken responsibly for anything.

So far for my entire adult life I have seen my income half in buying power from Republicans, my taxes go up by Republicans (yeah, 2% income tax reduction but a fuck over of deductions for many thousands), and the cost of goods go up by a lot due to tariffs (taxes) Republicans implemented and due to Covid response failure.  So everything costs a bunch more, my dollars goes half as far, and my taxes are fucked so I also pay more.  Thanks Republicans.  It's been great!

Staying in the EU seemed like the path of least resistance. The EU had excellent advantages. It really did.

Leaving the EU was going to have problems. No way around it. Things have to change and countries aren't speedboats, they are oil tankers. Changing course is tricky.

Now for a good many people the reasons for and against were partly ugly or abhorrent (immigration and latent racism). I don't care about immigration. The UK has been enriched time and time again by cultures moving in and adding their nuances to the tapestry of the history of this country. 

I voted because:

1) Federal states have huge problems. Look at the US. The constant fighting and partisanship, wildly different local laws sometimes in huge juxtaposition to the federal stance. Sometimes rightly i.e more progressive movements, better equalities legislation and protection, minimum wage, heck even libertarian ideals like legalisation of marijuana, perfect. Sometimes wrongly, catering to extreme religious views, banning abortion etc.

2) I wanted less government. You can make arguments as to how efficient things were but it didn't stop the fact for me that I lived under 4 layers of government (local, Scottish, UK and EU). 

3) I don't want another army. The EU is pushing for an army. More budget assigned to military is bad for me and more chance of being involved in conflict which just absolutely hasn't worked in decades.

4) The countries within the EU (even the UK, maybe especially the UK) were not conforming and would often make decisions in self interest that had negative consequences for others. If we hadn't got it right at that fundamental level I would have liked to have seen is fix that first.

If the EU was going to remain the useful entity that it was without creeping further and further I would have been happy but it wasn't headed that way and it was leading to more clutter and further costs and responsibilities.

1208,Dfiggsmeister,alexrobinson,2021-09-28 17:44:13,"There are generally three factors seen in all the examples of hyperinflation throughout history these are:

- **Major reduction in productive capacity (supply)**: this has not dropped to dangerous levels, it may have dropped but nowhere near to the levels you're claiming. In historical examples of hyperinflation, usually this capacity was decimated by war or drought and famine.

- **Capital outflows (money/investment leaving the nation)**: Brexit definitely did lead to many companies pulling out of the UK but overall the nation's capital flows have remained roughly inline with pre-Brexit levels. Again outflows in previous examples of hyperinflation are usually caused by trade embargoes or sanctions, something we just are not seeing here.

- **Large increase in the money supply (aka money printing)**: The money supply has increased quite sharply due to the pandemic but again, nowhere near to the levels seen in actual examples of hyperinflation (for example [go here and compare this graph for Zimbabwe's M2 money supply to the UK](https://tradingeconomics.com/zimbabwe/money-supply-m2)). 

The third factor is the only one you could argue is remotely applicable to the UK currently, as it is for most developed nations who have passed stimulus bills to boost economic recovery following the pandemic. We may see increased inflation to account for this but to put it into perspective, the UK's inflation rate sits at around 3.2%, following the end of WW2 with major manufacturing centres of the nation having been bombed to bits for a year straight inflation rose to 16.76%. To give a true example of hyperinflation, in 1946 following the Hungarian hyperinflation crisis the total value of all Hungarian banknotes in circulation amounted to 1/1000th of a US cent.

But then the next point immediately was ""The brits are not inclined to go and work these demeaning jobs that pay very little""  
Yeah? That's why 99% of them were done by foreigners who will do minimum wage demeaning jobs, because that wage is probably 2x-3x more than the equivalent back at whatever 3rd world country they came from, most of them also live in either rented rooms or tiny apartments, not own property or houses with gardens. They also put way more effort into the job so they can retain it, because they are just a lowly foreigner.  
And now that brexit happened people move to other EU countries instead. A lot of these foreigners come that don't even speak english properly or at all, so blocking their entry and them going to something like germany does not really change much for them, the language barrier is the same.","UK: ""We want out of the EU, get those foreigners out of here!""

Barriers to trade with new customs and regulatory checks, 

These increased checks leading to inflation and higher prices for UK consumers, 

UK firms losing EU contracts due to increased red tape,

The destruction of the fishing and other industries, 

Labour shortages in crucial industries like agriculture and services, 

Consumer and workplace protections afforded by EU being removed, 

Loss of EU investment in the UK - farming subsidies, university and research grants, grants to improve deprived areas and infrastructure, 

The loss of health and safety protections enshrined in EU law, 

Consumers losing competition law protections and the EU standing up to huge corporations to reign in their anti-consumer practices, 

That if the UK wants to trade with the EU it has to comply with EU laws but no longer has any say in those laws.

I, as an EU resident, would gladly support you getting back, lunatic politicians be damned. 

No grudges, no questions, heck, you can even get the same contract you had before for all I care. Not that I personally would gain anything meaningful from it, but more of a belief that we all benefit from being in an union and I miss the UK as one of ""the big three"". It just seems logical to me that the UK should be an integral part of European experiment.","I have arrived in Portugal for a holiday. It was fking nightmare.

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but [Volt](https://voltuk.eu/) is a small party operating across European borders as well as in the UK. They're generally center-left, libertarian and their main goal is to strenghten and expand the EU. They also want to get the UK to rejoin the EU.","I have arrived in Portugal for a holiday.

Why? Their influence since Margret Thatcher has been antagonistic towards EU, and indulgent Towards American (and  now; Chinese) imperialism.","As a US citizen, I appreciate this thread. I wondered how bad things would get. Trump supported Brexit and I figured if he supported it, Brexit had to be a massively bad idea.

The GOP in the states is exactly the same. Republicans have had 20+ years to develop a health care system for US citizens and have come up with literally zero.

3015,None,Asgand,2023-12-30 18:07:48,"If you look at it in context with the War in Ukraine it makes even more sense that the current Conservative Party is a conspiracy against the British people:

\- The day after a key NATO summit discussing the Salisbury Poisonings, Boris Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, flies from that summit to Evgeny Lebedev's private villa in Italy. Lebedev's father Alexander is a key Russian oligarch, friend of Putin, and member of the KGB. Johnson took no security and told nobody he was going until after the fact. The only reason we know he went was members of the public recognised him at the airport the morning after looking 'bedraggled and unkempt' and went to the papers with photographs. It would have been very easy for him to disclose key NATO secrets at this meeting.

\- Matthew Elliot, head of Vote Leave, founded the Conservative Friends of Russia group. Members included Boris Johnson and his now wife Carrie Symonds. Photographs online show Boris with Sergey Nalobin, another member of this group who was a Russian 'diplomat' again with links to the KGB/FSB. Nalobin has since left the UK and lives in a flat linked to the KGB.

\- Since the start of the War in Ukraine the Conservative Party has received donations to the tune of approx ¬£243,000 from Russian intelligence linked donors. This includes  Lubov Chernukhin.

\- Dominic Cummings, who became Boris' senior advisor, spent 3 years in Russia in the 90's and speaks fluent Russian.

EDIT: Further - Boris made Lebedev a Lord in his Resignation Honors list. This was against direct advice from MI6 that he had links to Russian intelligence and should not be made a Lord. Likewise, Liz Truss has just made Matthew Elliot a Lord despite him being the CEO of Vote Leave (which she voted against) and Founder of the Conservative Friends of Russia. It's actually ridiculously obvious. Don't let Boris going to Ukraine every verse end fool you. If he was working for the Russian's he'd want to be in Ukraine as often as possible and privy to their information and intelligence.","It‚Äôs easiest just to accept that the Conservative Party is a straight up conspiracy against the British people at this point.

Start having the painful discussions of accepting that the world needs a United Europe. We need need each other where the world is going.

---

It is rare  for voters to change their minds soon after referendums. Experience from Canada to Scotland, from Norway to Switzerland, suggests rather that opinions tend to move in favour of a referendum result more than they swing against it. But Brexit seems to be an exception. Since the 52-48% vote in favour of leaving the European Union in June 2016, the majority view among Britons has shifted, and especially so in the past two years, towards the conclusion that the decision was wrong (see chart).

One way to take the temperature is to visit two English towns called Richmond which voted in very different ways in 2016. In Richmond-upon-Thames in London, which voted 69-31% to remain in the eu, opinion has hardened. Gareth Roberts, the Liberal Democrat council leader, notes that post-Brexit niggles such as longer border delays and more intrusive passport controls have helped to solidify local opposition. A Leave voter sitting by the river says he has not changed his mind, but that he is disappointed by the Tories‚Äô failure to strike big trade deals outside the eu.

The other Richmond, in north Yorkshire, voted 57-43% for Brexit. One Leaver in the market square echoes his southern counterpart by insisting that he still supports Brexit but he complains that it has not been properly done and that immigration has surged despite repeated Tory promises to reduce it. A local bartender says that she voted instinctively to leave but that, were the referendum re-run, she would work harder to understand what it would really mean. Stuart Parsons, a former mayor of Richmond, claims that several friends have changed their minds, especially small farmers who feel betrayed by the Conservatives and now fret about future lost public subsidies.

Such anecdotes chime with polls across the country. Research by uk in a Changing Europe (ukice), a think-tank, finds that most voters have not in fact changed their minds since 2016. But because as many as 16-20% of those who voted to leave have switched sides, compared with only 6% of those who voted to remain, the balance has swung against Brexit. The passage of time is also having its inevitable effect: older voters were overwhelmingly keen to leave the eu and younger ones were fiercely opposed to the idea. Don‚Äôt-knows and those who did not vote in 2016 now tend to break strongly against Brexit.

Explanations abound for the disillusionment. Sir John Curtice, a leading pollster who works with ukice, points especially to gloom about the economy since 2016, which he says matters more than irritation over immigration. Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat mp for Richmond Park, reckons that outright dishonesty on the part of the Leave campaign is to blame. Peter Kellner, a political pundit and former president of YouGov, a polling group, suggests that many Brexit supporters had no idea what would happen if they actually won. That differs sharply from the run-up to most other constitutional referendums.

Changes in the political background matter as well. The Conservatives under Rishi Sunak, who happens to be the mp for Richmond in Yorkshire and is a keen supporter of Brexit, are associated in voters‚Äô minds with the decision to Leave. Party disunity and the chaos of four prime ministers in five years have helped to discredit something with which the Tories are strongly identified.

Just as the Tories have helped tarnish views of Brexit, so Brexit is likely to hurt the Tories at the next election. A chunk of people who voted Leave in 2016 say there should still be long-term benefits from quitting the bloc but argue that too little has been done to realise them. This group now leans against the Tories and may even prefer the Reform Party, an insurgent right-wing party. In contrast, those who were against Brexit in 2016 think they were right to fear its economic impact; many who were Tory then now back Labour.

The anti-Brexit mood of a majority of voters is clear but that does not translate into a burning wish to refight old battles. Brexit may be unpopular but its political salience has faded. Even keen Remainers have doubts about the wisdom of starting a lengthy campaign to rejoin. The Labour Party‚Äôs decision to talk as little as possible about Brexit is understandable: the party hopes to regain ‚Äúred-wall‚Äù seats in the north and the Midlands that backed Brexit in 2016 and then voted Tory in the 2019 general election.

But if and when Labour does take office, there will be political wriggle-room to improve relations with the eu. Some in the party talk not just of expanding today‚Äôs thin trade deal but of broader alignment with European rules. Tory attacks on such ideas as a betrayal of the 2016 vote are less likely to resonate when Brexit itself has lost its appeal for many. ‚ñ†",Why most people regret Brexit

I did this for 1 main reason the free movement of labour. In the years preceding Brexit we saw a suppression of wages, reluctance to train British people and British companies to invest in mechanisation. 

I personally didn't care if GDP stagnates  within the UK and even if the mean wage comes down. I only care that the Median wage goes up in real terms. 

What leaving the EU should have done is reduced the Labour pool, particularly unskilled labour from Eastern Europe. This should have made workers have a greater bargaining position and be able to fight for better wages. 

This is something that is just impossible to do with free movement the unskilled working class would always get poorer as it was easy to import labour from poor countries. 

We have seen this in some sectors like HGV, farming  where employees had their wages increased and companies invested in training people/ better equipment. I am sure there are other examples that have not hit the news. 

Now only time will tell if this will work out in the longer term. As an example you look at Japan which has strict immigration,  although the Mean wage is pretty flat the median wage has increased year on year and is now at 95% of the mean compared to the UK where the median wage is just 83% of the mean wage.

Cockfield wrote and published a White Paper in 1985 identifying 300 measures to be addressed in order to complete a single market. The White Paper was well received and led to the adoption of the Single European Act, a treaty which reformed the decision-making mechanisms of the EEC and set a deadline of 31 December 1992 for the completion of a single market.

I am a software engineer, and I don't typically solve bugs in software by holding a poll of random people in the street.

I worked with alot of Europeans throughout my working life never had any issues with it. But most of them was working here for a few years then were able to buy houses in there mother countries across europe while I see myself and alot of British friends struggle to get by let alone buy our own place here.

Then that's when you see the problems with how this country was becoming a main work hub for Europeans to gain wealth and not the British living here.

Yes leaving the EU would maybe deter certain business from investing in our country due too certain availability for workers. But on the positive it also helps bring wages up and forces companies to pay a better living wage for this country to employ who they need when the work force is limited.

Alot of houses in working areas are rented out to four or five Europeans house sharing splitting rent between then. This drives rent through the roof for a 1 or 2 working person family to be able to afford in the future.
Capitalists and business love this as it only benefits them.

I see the comments about enviromental and workers rights for EU citizens working here but it mostly impacts EU workers. its all to be better off long term for our children and give our children's children a chance of having a life not a capitalist utopia for Europeans to grow wealth.

The NHS is struggling I admit but there is alot of problems within our current government. They havnt managed it the best they can because they've been so protective of keeping businesses and investment since leaving the EU. I believe it balances out with a decent government voted in and things will be better for the future of the working person here.

Greater distrust in the government is not because of Brexit but because of the behaviour of members of the government. Trust was already pretty low long before the Brexit campaign. Leave campaigns victory was predominantly due to their effective use of slogans and tapping into people's fears and emotions. This was helped by remain campaign being complacent and not extolling the benefits of remaining in the eU whilst tearing down the strawman arguments by the leave campaign.

We then get loads of headlines like ""worst performing in G8"" making everyone believe it's all gone to shit and then a year later all the stats get revised upwards and it turns out we were actually in the top 2 or 3 instead because most of the other countries had done really optimistic estimates instead.

It reignited border issues in Northern Ireland. The investments got eaten by a stalling economy. And, those trade deals are nowhere to be seen.

4296,Wanna_Know_it_all,dtr9,2024-04-25 11:38:57,"Personally I don't see Brexit as a cause so much as a symptom.

Brexit, just like the ""culture wars"", stoking anti-immigrant sentiment, and the endless picking of fights with targets real and imagined, is all just Tory strategy.

While ""the left"" endlessly seek to portray the nation as divided by the distribution of wealth and power, the Tories need an alternative vision.  In previous administrations they've been able to turn to the ""rising tide lifting all boats"", but post economic crisis with the imposition of austerity, that's not at all possible.  Even if the tide were rising, austerity as a policy choice deliberately leaves people underwater and we all know it.

So Tory success is reliant on the degree to which they can avoid people thinking about the divisions of wealth and power, and they have sought to achieve that by presenting, and indeed creating, alternative ways to divide the country, Brexit being by far the most successful.  As the power of Brexit as a cause of national division has waned, their focus has turned to culture wars, immigration, and endless attempts to portray themselves (the party of government for 13 years) as engaged in a war against the ""true"" authorities and elites of the country (""the blob"", ""the anti-growth coalition"", etc).

So yes, England has become considerably more grim during the Tories time in power, not least because we've constantly been pushed into these low-intensity, often inter-generational ""civil wars"" fermented by our own government to keep us distracted while they run down public services and abandon swathes of the population to destitution, all the while looking for opportunities to reduce tax on the ever smaller percentage of the population lucky enough to still be afloat.",Has England become more grim because of Brexit?

Polluted water - the water is not any more polluted than it has been historically (with the one exception that 2023 was an unusually rainy year and so there were more storm outflows).

The reason it has become such a politicised issue is that from 2016 until last year we started installing monitoring equipment on the combined sewage outflows for the fist time.

For myself, I work in the NHS. Although they have just added increased funding, the main problem has been the lack of funding over the last 12 years, and not really anything to do with BREXIT.

4378,Wanna_Know_it_all,ChrisFromLondon,2024-04-26 07:33:20,"Dutchie here. Ive left the country after 25 years.

Brexit changed the tone of the debate. With just a small majority, everything became black and white. Pro vs Con.
However it's not dissimilar to what the New Right around Wilders is doing in holland, where every ill of society is blamed on immigration. Low wages, high rents, etc. Many such issues are western trends, and have little real cause from immigration.
Brexit allowed the UK another scapegoat for their troubles: the EU.
The cause of the 'cost of living crisis', or 'nhs crisis' lies elsewhere, but this is another debate.

As for me, the tone of debate has made feel many very, very unwelcome. Europeans working in all sorts of sectors (hospitality, education, construction, healthare) have been obstructed in their lifes. For example, two rounds of applying for residency. Employers now asking for your proof of status. Difficulties crossing borders. Life for many became uncertain. Though this situation is now improving.

And while 'Jane' living in a sh*thole like Harwich hasn't seen much difference, she still lives in an impoverished sh*thole.

Brexit affected mostly those millions of Brits that have some connection with Europe. Holiday homes, work, family, etc. Suddenly you're no longer allowed to stay in the eu for more than 60 days. Moving house, or things, across the border is a costly nightmare. Legal papers, such as marriage certificates, are no longer recognised without an expensive aposttile. A UK driving licence is now the same as one from Ha√Øti. The Erasmus program was replaced by some shitty new arrangement. On a regulatory level the changes are massive. Cost of banking across the border became more difficult and  expensive.
I was able to get an expensive double nationality, but this is frowned upon in Holland.
For all this I, and many others, are properly pissed off at the costly consequences. 
And when you complain about things to either government services 'But the people voted Brexit...'.

It's sad.

When i moved to London in the late nineties, I was amazed at how well a multicultural society can work. London really was the best city in the world. I easily made friends with people with backgrounds from all over the world. Brighton is in effect as suburp of London. Holland was, and still is, lightyears behind on this. Though in the poorer areas of London (think 'innercity' schools), this picture is quite different.

But above all: I've felt proud to be European all me life. And still am more European than anything else. I'm happy to be back in the EU.

And the sewage in Brighton? European regulations were actively driving change in the UK's waste water treatment.

No wonder the mood is a little grim.

Despite the rhetoric to the contrary the UK was a significant voice around the table in developing and agreeing EU policy measures. They have now lost that voice almost entirely and are in the same position as any third country. 

That matters because of the ""Brussels effect"", whereby EU regulation tends to set a standard that reaches well past the borders of the EU. That's seen pretty clearly in items like the GDPR, where the UK despite leaving has effectively had to mirror GDPR provisions in their domestic Data Protection Act. 

GDPR, and any EU regulation, has its obvious and stated goals, but is also a tool of economic policy. If data economy companies like Meta and Google were EU companies it's unlikely that the GDPR would be anything like as stringent as it ended up becoming. EU member states battle hard for the economic interests of their companies. Looking forward the EU is hoping to replicate that effect in their AI regulation, which will no doubt be recast as the field continues to evolve. AI companies in the EU will be able to influence that through their Governments, whereas those in the UK will end up being rule-takers if they want to do business in the EU.","What soft power does it lose due to brexit?

And the Brits need to reevaluate their position in the world and how they talk to other countries for this to be successful.","If the UK were to join the US as the 51st state, it would be the 51st poorest state (by GDP per capita).

UK is experiencing the same economic stagnation affecting the rest of the EU, regardless of EU membership. Their relative influence has gone down, but I doubt the Brexit had much to do with it."

I expected some economic hardship and I expect there's worse to come. I voted leave because the UK and the EU wanted fundamentally different things. The currency union will eventually result in a banking union and then a political union. The state that struggling economies like Greece are in isn't meaningfully improving. This isn't necessarily their fault. Usually a struggling but stable nation sees it's currency devalue making it easier to export and bringing wealth and recovery. This isn't possible with the Euro. If the wealthier nations keep having to bail out the struggling ones their voters will eventually demand a meaningful say in how that country is run and the struggling country will demand reciprocation. The EU needs to federalise eventually if it is to function properly. 

Prior to 2016 the UK was using its veto far more frequently than any other nation and it was demanding carve outs from various treaties, think Schengen zone, euro etc. the UK was a drag on the EUs ever greater union and the EU was trying to impose unionization on a country not interested in further integration.

I believed and still believe that it would take a fundamental change.in the British mindset before the UK's membership to the EU would be in both parties interest.
